Raw scores (N = 1,704) from 142 raters across nine high school solo and ensemble festivals (grades 9–12) were collected using a 29-item Likert-type rating scale embedded within five domains (tone/intonation, n = 6; balance, n = 5; interpretation, n = 6; rhythm, n = 6; and technical accuracy, n = 6). Data were analyzed using a Many Facets Rasch Partial Credit Model. An a priori k-means cluster analysis of 29 differential rater functioning indices produced a discrete feature vector that classified raters into one of three distinct rater-types: (a) syntactical rater-type, (b) expressive rater-type, or (c) mental representation rater-type. Results of the initial Random Forest model resulted in an out-of-bag error rate of 5.05%, indicating that approximately 95% of the raters were correctly classified. After tuning a set of three hyperparameters (ntree, mtry, and node size), the optimized model demonstrated an improved out-of-bag error rate of 2.02%. Implications for improvements in assessment, research, and rater training in the field of music education are discussed. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070696952

This article proposes a hybrid adaptive framework to combine both CAT and MST, inspired by an analysis of the history of CAT and MST. The proposed procedure is a design which transitions from a group sequential design to a fully sequential design. This allows for the robustness of MST in early stages, but also shares the advantages of CAT in later stages with fine tuning of the ability estimator once its neighborhood has been identified. Simulation results showed that hybrid designs following our proposed principles provided comparable or even better estimation accuracy and efficiency than standard CAT and MST designs, especially for examinees at the two ends of the ability range. © 2016 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960383117

PRPs could be useful in measuring careless responding and traitedness. However, it is unclear how well current procedures for estimating PRPs can recover parameter estimates. This study assesses these procedures in terms of mean error (ME), average absolute difference (AAD), and reliability using simulated data with known values. Several prior distributions for PRPs were compared across a number of conditions. Overall, our results revealed little differences between using the χ or lognormal distributions as priors for estimated PRPs. Both distributions produced estimates with reasonable levels of ME; however, the AAD of the estimates was high. AAD did improve slightly as the number of items increased, suggesting that increasing the number of items would ameliorate this problem. Similarly, a larger number of items were necessary to produce reasonable levels of reliability. Based on our results, several conclusions are drawn and implications for future research are discussed. © 2018 by the National Council on Measurement in Education",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052561627

This study proposes a new item selection method within the framework of dual-objective CD-CAT that simultaneously addresses examinees' attribute mastery status and overall test performance. The new procedure is based on the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence, a symmetrized version of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We show that the JS divergence resolves the noncomparability problem of the dual information index and has close relationships with Shannon entropy, mutual information, and Fisher information. The performance of the JS divergence is evaluated in simulation studies in comparison with the methods available in the literature. Results suggest that the JS divergence achieves parallel or more precise recovery of latent trait variables compared to the existing methods and maintains practical advantages in computation and item pool usage.

Often new test forms are constructed to be parallel with an existing (or an ideal) test. Within the context of item response theory, the test information function (TIF) or the test characteristic curve (TCC) are commonly used as statistical targets to obtain this parallelism. In a recent study, Ali and van Rijn proposed combining the TIF and TCC as statistical targets, rather than using only a single statistical target. In this article, we propose two new methods using this combined approach, and compare these methods with single statistical targets for the assembly of mixed-format tests. In addition, we introduce new criteria to evaluate the parallelism of multiple forms. The results show that single statistical targets can be problematic, while the combined targets perform better, especially in situations with increasing numbers of polytomous items.

Rescaling the standard (i.e., applying common-item equating methodology to standard setting ratings to account for systematic differences between standard setting panels) has received almost no attention in the literature. Identity equating was also examined to provide context. Data from a standard setting form of a large national certification test (N examinees = 4,397; N panelists = 13) were split into content-equivalent subforms with common items, and resampling methodology was used to investigate the error introduced by each approach. Common-item equating (circle-arc and nominal weights mean) was evaluated at samples of size 10, 25, 50, and 100. The standard setting approaches (resetting and rescaling the standard) were evaluated by resampling (N = 8) and by simulating panelists (N = 8, 13, and 20). Results were inconclusive regarding the relative effectiveness of resetting and rescaling the standard. Small-sample equating, however, consistently produced new form cut scores that were less biased and less prone to random error than new form cut scores based on resetting or rescaling the standard. © 2016 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960423338

The quality of human ratings largely determines the reliability, validity, and fairness of the assessment process. Our research recommends that the evaluation of ratings should be based on two aspects: a theoretical model of human judgment and an appropriate measurement model for evaluating these judgments. In rater-mediated assessments, the underlying constructs and response processes may require the use of different rater judgment models and the application of different measurement models. We describe the use of Brunswik's lens model as an organizing theme for conceptualizing human judgments in rater-mediated assessments. The constructs vary depending on which distal variables are identified in the lens models for the underlying rater-mediated assessment. For example, one lens model can be developed to emphasize the measurement of student proficiency, while another lens model can stress the evaluation of rater accuracy. Next, we describe two measurement models that reflect different response processes (cumulative and unfolding) from raters: Rasch and hyperbolic cosine models. Future directions for the development and evaluation of rater-mediated assessments are suggested. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069817328

Designing tests in this way is believed to maximize the classification accuracy and consistency of the assessment. This article uses simulated examples to illustrate that one can obtain higher classification accuracy and consistency by designing tests that have maximum test information at locations other than at the cut score. We show that the location where one should maximize the test information is dependent on the length of the test, the mean of the ability distribution in comparison to the cut score, and, to a lesser degree, whether or not one wants to optimize classification accuracy or consistency. Analyses also suggested that the differences in classification performance between designing tests optimally versus maximizing information at the cut score tended to be greatest when tests were short and the mean of ability distribution was further away from the cut score.

In this study, the detection methods of differential item discrimination (DID) over levels and the consequences of ignoring DID are illustrated and discussed with the use of multilevel item response models. Simulation results showed that the likelihood ratio test (LRT) performed well in detecting global DID at the test level when some portion of the items exhibited DID. At the item level, the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the sample-size adjusted Bayesian information criterion (saBIC), LRT, and Wald test showed a satisfactory rejection rate (>.8) when some portion of the items exhibited DID and the items had lower intraclass correlations (or higher DID magnitudes).

Additionally, we examine the impact of testlet length on both person and item recovery. Overall, our results suggest that no single approach works best across the studied conditions. With respect to the mean person parameter recovery, IRT scoring (via either Fisher information or preliminary EAP estimates) outperformed classical NC methods, although differences in bias and root mean squared error were generally small.

This simulation study examines how equating results compare for different approaches to handling structural zeros. The study considers four approaches: the no-smoothing, unique-common, total-common, and adjusted total-common approaches. This study led to four main findings: (1) the total-common approach generally had the worst results; (2) for relatively small effect sizes, the unique-common approach generally had the smallest overall error; (3) for relatively large effect sizes, the adjusted total-common approach generally had the smallest overall error; and, (4) if sole interest focuses on reducing bias only, the adjusted total-common approach was generally preferable. These results suggest that, when common items are internal and log-linear bivariate presmoothing is performed, structural zeros should be maintained, even if there is some loss in the moment preservation property.

Research has shown that when all items are multiple-choice, this bias can largely be eliminated. However, many assessments have a combination of multiple-choice and constructed response items. Using vertically scaled numeracy assessments from a large-scale assessment program, this article shows that eliminating the bias on estimates of the multiple-choice items also impacts on the difficulty estimates of the constructed response items. This implies that the original estimates of the constructed response items were biased by the guessing on the multiple-choice items. This bias has implications for both defining difficulties in item banks for use in adaptive testing composed of both multiple-choice and constructed response items, and for the construction of proficiency scales.

Because of the difficulties associated with collecting evidence related to external criteria, validity arguments rely heavily on evidence related to internal criteria—especially evidence that expert judgments are internally consistent. Given its importance, it is somewhat surprising that evidence of this kind has rarely been published in the context of the widely used bookmark standard-setting procedure. In this article we examined the effect of ordered item booklet difficulty on content experts’ bookmark judgments. If panelists make internally consistent judgments, their resultant cut scores should be unaffected by the difficulty of their respective booklets. This internal consistency was not observed: the results suggest that substantial systematic differences in the resultant cut scores can arise when the difficulty of the ordered item booklets varies. These findings raise questions about the ability of content experts to make the judgments required by the bookmark procedure.

After reviewing the approach, we conceptually embedded a computer-based collaborative behavior assessment (COLBAS) into the overarching PISA 2015 CPS approach. COLBAS is an H-A CPS assessment instrument that can be used to measure certain aspects of CPS. In addition, we applied a model-based cluster analysis to the embedded COLBAS aspects.

When these restrictions occur, the ratings observed during operational teacher evaluations are limited to a subset of the available categories. However, range restrictions are less common within teacher performances that are used to establish links (anchor ratings) in otherwise disconnected assessment systems. As a result, principals’ category use may be different between anchor ratings and operational ratings. The purpose of this study is to explore the consequences of discrepancies in rating scale category use across operational and anchor ratings within the context of teacher evaluation systems based on principal observations. First, we used real data to illustrate the presence of range restriction in operational ratings, and the effect of this restriction on connectivity. Then, we used simulated data to explore these effects using experimental manipulation. Results suggested that discrepancies in range restriction between anchor and operational ratings do not systematically impact the precision of teacher, principal, and teaching practice estimates. We discuss the implications of these results in terms of research and practice for teacher evaluation systems.

In practice, raters may exhibit various tendencies such as using middle or extreme scores in their ratings, which is referred to as the rater centrality/extremity response style. To achieve better measurement quality in rater data, it is desirable to simultaneously consider both rater severity and rater centrality/extremity. A new facets model is thus developed by adding to the Rasch facets model a weight parameter for the item thresholds for each rater. The parameters of the new facets model can be estimated with the JAGS freeware. An empirical example is provided to illustrate the implications and applications of the new model. Two simulation studies were conducted. The first simulation was to evaluate the parameter recovery of the new facets model and the consequences of ignoring the effects of rater centrality/extremity on parameter estimation.

Judges selected for standard-setting panels should have the proper qualifications to make the judgments asked of them; however, even qualified judges vary in expertise and in some cases, such as highly specialized areas or when members of the public are involved, it may be difficult to ensure that each member of a standard-setting panel has the requisite expertise to make qualified judgments. Given the subjective nature of these types of judgments, and that a large part of the validity argument for an exam lies in the robustness of its passing standard, an examination of the influence of judge proficiency on the judgments is warranted. This study explores the use of the many-facet Rasch model as a method for adjusting modified Angoff standard-setting ratings based on judges’ proficiency levels.

The LP is assumed to have features that go beyond a typical multidimentional IRT model, in that there are hypothesized to be certain cross-dimensional linkages that correspond to requirements between the levels of the different dimensions. The new model builds on multidimensional item response theory models and change-point analysis to add cut-score and discontinuity parameters that embody these substantive requirements. This modeling strategy allows us to place the examinees in the appropriate LP level and simultaneously to model the hypothesized requirement relations. Results from a simulation study indicate that the proposed change-point SCM recovers the generating parameters well. When the hypothesized requirement relations are ignored, the model fit tends to become worse, and the model parameters appear to be more biased. Moreover, the proposed model can be used to find validity evidence to support or disprove initial theoretical hypothesized links in the LP through empirical data. We illustrate the technique with data from an assessment system designed to measure student progress in a middle-school statistics and modeling curriculum.

The transition diagnostic classification model (TDCM) was recently developed to assess growth, defined as change in attribute mastery status over time, in a diagnostic classification model framework.

Several recent publications have employed the deviance information criterion (DIC) to do model selection among different forms of multilevel item response theory models (MLIRT). The majority of the practitioners use WinBUGS for implementing MCMC algorithms for MLIRT models, and the default version of DIC provided by WinBUGS focused on the measurement-level parameters only. The results herein show that this version of DIC is inappropriate. This study introduces five variants of DIC as a model selection index for MLIRT models with dichotomous outcomes. Considering a multilevel IRT model with three levels, five forms of DIC are formed: first-level conditional DIC computed from the measurement model only, which is the index given by many software packages such as WinBUGS; second-level marginalized DIC and second-level joint DIC computed from the second-level model; and top-level marginalized DIC and top-level joint DIC computed from the entire model. We evaluate the performance of the five model selection indices via simulation studies. The manipulated factors include the number of groups, the number of second-level covariates, the number of top-level covariates, and the types of measurement models (one-parameter vs. two-parameter). Considering the computational viability and interpretability, the second-level joint DIC is recommended for MLIRT models under our simulated conditions. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062820638

This study introduced a route-based top-down design approach that directly sets design parameters at the test level and utilizes the advanced automated test assembly algorithm seeking global optimality. The design process in this approach consists of five sub-processes: (1) route mapping, (2) setting objectives, (3) setting constraints, (4) routing error control, and (5) test assembly. Results from a simulation study confirmed that the assembly, measurement and routing results of the top-down design eclipsed those of the bottom-up design. Additionally, the top-down design approach provided unique insights into design decisions that could be used to refine the test. Regardless of these advantages, it is recommended applying both top-down and bottom-up approaches in a complementary manner in practice.

Several and several module assembly methods for CD-OMST were proposed and compared in terms of measurement precision, test security, and constrain management. The module assembly methods in the study included the maximum priority index method (MPI), the revised maximum priority index (RMPI), the weighted deviation model (WDM), and the two revised Monte Carlo methods (R1-MC, R2-MC). Simulation results showed that on the whole the CD-OMST performs well in that it not only has acceptable attribute pattern correct classification rates but also satisfies both statistical and nonstatistical constraints; the RMPI method was generally better than the MPI method, the R2-MC method was generally better than the R1-MC method, and the two revised Monte Carlo methods performed best in terms of test security and constraint management, whereas the RMPI and WDM methods worked best in terms of measurement precision.

In many common cases, security concerns lead to the use of form-specific CR items that cannot be used for equating test scores, along with MC sections that can be linked to previous test forms via common items. In such cases, adjustment by minimum discriminant information may be used to link CR section scores and composite scores based on both MC and CR sections. This approach is an innovative extension that addresses the long-standing issue of linking CR test scores across test forms in the absence of common items in educational measurement. It is applied to a series of administrations from an international language assessment with MC sections for receptive skills and CR sections for productive skills. To assess the linking results, harmonic regression is applied to examine the effects of the proposed linking method on score stability, among several analyses for evaluation. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066780312

Therefore, much useful information about the item's functioning is ignored. In earlier work, we developed the Bayesian updating (BU) DIF procedure for dichotomous items and showed how it could be used to formally aggregate DIF results over administrations. More recently, we extended the BU method to the case of polytomously scored items. We conducted an extensive simulation study that included four “administrations” of a test. For the single-administration case, we compared the Bayesian approach to an existing polytomous-DIF procedure. For the multiple-administration case, we compared BU to two non-Bayesian methods of aggregating the polytomous-DIF results over administrations.

This study examined longitudinal scoring data collected during three consecutive administrations of a large-scale, multi-state summative assessment program. Multilevel models were used to assess the overall extent of rater leniency/severity during scoring and examine the extent to which leniency/severity effects were stable across the three administrations. Model results were then applied to scaled scores to estimate the impact of the stability of leniency/severity effects on students’ scores. Results showed relative scoring stability across administrations in mathematics. In English language arts, short constructed response items showed evidence of slightly increasing severity across administrations, while essays showed mixed results: evidence of both slightly increasing severity and moderately increasing leniency over time, depending on trait. However, when model results were applied to scaled scores, results revealed rater effects had minimal impact on students’ scores. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070701631

In this study, two-dimensional data were generated under varying conditions. The two-dimensional data sets were analyzed with one- to five-class mixture Rasch models. Results of the simulation study indicate the mixture Rasch model tended to extract more latent classes than the number of dimensions simulated, particularly when the multidimensional structure of the data was more complex. In addition, the number of extracted latent classes decreased as the dimensions were more highly correlated regardless of multidimensional structure. An analysis of the empirical multidimensional data also shows that the number of latent classes extracted by the mixture Rasch model is larger than the number of dimensions measured by the test. © 2018 by the National Council on Measurement in Education",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052580343

In this article, ATC21S collaborative assessments focus on the project's “ICT Literacy—Learning in digital networks” learning progression. The article includes a description of the development of the learning progression, as well as examples and the logic behind the instrument construction. Assessments took place in random pairs of students in a demonstration digital environment. Modeling of results employed unidimensional and multidimensional item response models, with and without random effects for groups. The results indicated that, based on this data set, the models that take group into consideration in both the unidimensional and the multidimensional analyses fit better. However, the group-level variances were substantially higher than the individual-level variances. This indicates that a total individual estimate of group plus individual is likely a more informative estimate than individual alone but also that the performances of the pairs dominated the performances of the individuals. Implications are discussed in the results and conclusions.

In this study, we used simulated data to examine the sensitivity of latent trait model indicators of three rater effects (leniency, central tendency, and severity) in combination with different types of incomplete rating designs (systematic links, anchor performances, and spiral). We used the rating scale model and the partial credit model to calculate rater location estimates, standard errors of rater estimates, model–data fit statistics, and the standard deviation of rating scale category thresholds as indicators of rater effects and we explored the sensitivity of these indicators to rater effects under different conditions. Our results suggest that it is possible to detect rater effects when each of the three types of rating designs is used. However, there are differences in the sensitivity of each indicator related to type of rater effect, type of rating design, and the overall proportion of effect raters.

This leads to an intuitive notion of engagement among collaborators, and we consider a model-based index that can be used to quantify this notion. The approach is illustrated using a simulation-based task designed for science education, in which pairs of collaborators interact using online chat.

The purpose of this study is to use classical test theory (CTT) and cognitive diagnostic modeling (CDM) frameworks to examine psychometric properties of the van Hiele Geometry Test and to compare how various classification criteria assign van Hiele levels to students. The findings support the hierarchical property of the van Hiele theory and levels. Using conventional and combined criteria to determine mastery of a level, the percentages of students classified into an overall level were relatively high. Although some items had aberrant difficulties and low item discrimination, varied selection of the criteria across levels improved item discrimination power, especially for those items with low item discrimination index (IDI) estimates. Based on the findings, we identify items on the van Hiele Geometry Test that might be revised and we suggest changes to classification criteria to increase the number of students who can be assigned an overall level of geometry thinking according to the theory.

If the tests consist of different items with multiple categories for each item, a suitable model for the responses is a polytomous item response theory (IRT) model. The parameters from such a model can be utilized to derive the score probabilities for the tests and these score probabilities may then be used in observed-score equating. In this study, the asymptotic standard errors of observed-score equating using score probability vectors from polytomous IRT models are derived using the delta method. The results are applied to the equivalent groups design and the nonequivalent groups design with either chain equating or poststratification equating within the framework of kernel equating. The derivations are presented in a general form and specific formulas for the graded response model and the generalized partial credit model are provided. The asymptotic standard errors are accurate under several simulation conditions relating to sample size, distributional misspecification and, for the nonequivalent groups design, anchor test length.

This article suggests a new statistic that is based on the likelihood ratio test. An advantage of the new statistic is that it follows the standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis of no aberrant answer changes. It is demonstrated in a detailed simulation study that the Type I error rate of the new statistic is very close to the nominal level and the power of the new statistic is satisfactory in comparison to those of several existing statistics for detecting aberrant answer changes. The new statistic and several existing statistics were shown to provide useful information for a real data set.

Essentially, this approach involves examining the unexpected ratings that each misfitting rater assigned (i.e., carrying out analyses of standardized residuals). One can create plots of the standardized residuals, isolating those that resulted from raters’ ratings of particular subgroups. Practitioners can then examine the plots to identify raters who did not maintain a uniform level of severity when they assessed various subgroups (i.e., exhibited evidence of differential rater functioning). In this study, we analyzed simulated and real data to explore the utility of this between-subgroup fit approach.

The researchers use the parametric anchoring vignette method to correct for cross-country incomparability of students’ reports on teacher's classroom management. Their analysis is based on the data from the Programme for International Student Assessment 2012. The results show significant variation in implicit standards across countries. Correlations between countries’ average teacher classroom management levels and external variables like students test scores and public expenditure per pupil change substantially after vignette adjustment.

To address this issue, four interval estimation procedures that use category subscores for the computation of confidence intervals are presented in this article. All four estimation procedures assume that subscores instead of test scores follow a binomial distribution (i.e., compound binomial error model).

In the DP method, the key judgment task for panelists is a decision on whether or not individual cognitive skill profiles meet the performance standard. A randomized experiment was carried out in which secondary mathematics teachers were randomly assigned to either the DP method or the modified Angoff method. The standard setting methods were applied to a test of student readiness to enter high school algebra (Algebra I). While the DP profile judgments were perceived to be more difficult than the Angoff item judgments, there was a high degree of agreement among the panelists for most of the profiles. In order to compare the methods, cut scores were generated from the DP method. The results of the DP group were comparable to the Angoff group, with less cut score variability in the DP group. The DP method shows promise for testing situations in which diagnostic information is needed about examinees and where that information needs to be linked to a performance standard.

The objective of this article is to advance three claims about why teachers and assessment scholars/specialists may have little understanding of students’ interpretation of formative assessment feedback. The three claims are as follows. First, there is little systematic research of K-12 students’ interpretations of feedback. Systematic research requires gathering substantive evidence of students’ cognitive and emotional processes using psychological methods and tools. Second, there is an overemphasis on the external assessment process at the expense of uncovering learners’ internal reasoning and emotional processes. This overemphasis may be due to vestiges of behavioral approaches and lack of training in social cognitive methods. Third, there are psychological tools such as the clinical interview, pioneered by Piaget and used by psychologists to “enter the child's mind,” which may be helpful in uncovering students’ interpretation of feedback and associated behavioral responses. If the purpose of formative assessment is to change student learning, and feedback is delivered as a conduit to help with this long-term change, understanding students’ interpretation of feedback plays a central role in the validity of the process. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071013226

The goal of this article is to show how constraint programming (CP) can be used as an alternative to automate test-form generation problems with a large variety of formatting constraints, and how it compares with MIP-based form generation as for its models, solutions, and running times. Two empirical examples are presented: (i) automated generation of a computerized fixed-form; and (ii) automated generation of shadow tests for multistage testing.

We applied this model to survey items from TALIS 2013.

The impact of item-level nonresponse has not been investigated with regard to statistics that determine the size of these relationships (e.g., correlations, regression coefficients). Classical approaches such as ignoring missing values or treating them as incorrect are currently applied in many large-scale studies, while recent model-based approaches that can account for nonignorable nonresponse have been developed. Estimates of item and person parameters have been demonstrated to be biased for classical approaches when missing data are missing not at random (MNAR). In our study, we focus on parameter estimates of the structural model (i.e., the true regression coefficient when regressing competence on an explanatory variable), simulating data according to various missing data mechanisms. We found that model-based approaches and ignoring missing values performed well in retrieving regression coefficients even when we induced missing data that were MNAR. Treating missing values as incorrect responses can lead to substantial bias. We demonstrate the validity of our approach empirically and discuss the relevance of our results.

The method is based on the classical test theory and deems a subscore to be of added value if the subscore predicts the corresponding true subscore better than does the total score. Sinharay provided an interpretation of the added value of subscores in terms of scores and subscores on parallel forms. This article extends the results of Sinharay and considers the prediction of a subscore on a parallel form from both the subscore and the total raw score on the original form. The resulting predictor essentially becomes the augmented subscore suggested by Haberman. The proportional reduction in mean squared error of the resulting predictor is interpreted as a squared multiple correlation coefficient. The practical usefulness of the derived results is demonstrated using an operational data set.

In this study, person-fit statistics are proposed for joint models to detect aberrant response accuracy and/or response time patterns. The person-fit tests take the correlation between ability and speed into account, as well as the correlation between item characteristics. They are posited as Bayesian significance tests, which have the advantage that the extremeness of a test statistic value is quantified by a posterior probability. The person-fit tests can be computed as by-products of a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Simulation studies were conducted in order to evaluate their performance. For all person-fit tests, the simulation studies showed good detection rates in identifying aberrant patterns. A real data example is given to illustrate the person-fit statistics for the evaluation of the joint model.

A concern is that the high-stakes purpose may lead to distortions in the inferences about students and teachers that SLOs can support. This concern is explored in the present study by contrasting student SLO scores in a large urban school district to performance on a common objective external criterion. This external criterion is used to evaluate the extent to which student growth scores appear to be inflated. Using 2 years of data, growth comparisons are also made at the teacher level for teachers who submit SLOs and have students that take the state-administered large-scale assessment. Although they do show similar relationships with demographic covariates and have the same degree of stability across years, the two different measures of growth are weakly correlated. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071604207

Results generally indicated similarity between those scores, the corresponding scores for students preparing for high-skills jobs requiring a bachelor's degree, and established readiness benchmarks for the general college-going population.

Generally speaking, popular nonparametric methods for evaluating rating quality are not based on a particular measurement theory. On the other hand, popular parametric methods for evaluating rating quality are often based on measurement theories such as invariant measurement. However, these methods are based on assumptions and transformations that may not be appropriate for ordinal ratings. In this study, I show how researchers can use Mokken scale analysis (MSA), which is a nonparametric approach to item response theory, to evaluate rating quality within the framework of invariant measurement without the use of potentially inappropriate parametric techniques. I use an illustrative analysis of data from a rater-mediated writing assessment to demonstrate how one can use numeric and graphical indicators from MSA to gather evidence of validity, reliability, and fairness. The results from the analyses suggest that MSA provides a useful framework within which to evaluate rater-mediated assessments for evidence of validity, reliability, and fairness that can supplement existing popular methods for evaluating ratings. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069683166

In addition to modeling the appropriate trait structure, the multidimensional HRM (M-HRM) presented here also accounts for rater severity bias and rater variability or inconsistency. We introduce the model formulation, test parameter recovery with a focus on latent traits, and compare the M-HRM to other scoring approaches (unidimensional HRMs and a traditional multidimensional item response theory model) using simulated and empirical data.

It has three features to enhance classroom use: equated scale scores for progress monitoring within and across grades, a scale score to distinguish among low-scoring students based on patterns of mistakes, and a reading efficiency index. Instead of two response types for each multiple-choice item, correct and incorrect, each item has three response types: correct and two incorrect response types. Prior results on reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, and predictive utility of mistake subscores are briefly described. The three-response-type structure of items required rethinking the item response theory (IRT) modeling.

To handle this issue, this article proposes new indices to predict the correct classification rate of a diagnostic test before administering the test under the deterministic noise input “and” gate (DINA) model. The new indices include an item-level expected classification accuracy (ECA) for attributes and a test-level ECA for attributes and attribute patterns, and both of them are calculated based solely on the known item parameters and Q-matrix. Theoretical analysis showed that the item-level ECA could be regarded as a measure of correct classification rates of attributes contributed by an item. This article also illustrates how to apply the item-level ECA for attributes to estimate the correct classification rate of attributes patterns at the test level. Simulation results showed that two test-level ECA indices, ECA_I_W (an index based on the independence assumption and the weighted sum of the item-level ECAs) and ECA_C_M (an index based on Gaussian Copula function that incorporates the dependence structure of the events of attribute classification and the simple average of the item-level ECAs), could make an accurate prediction for correct classification rates of attribute patterns. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062867179

To provide review opportunities to examinees while minimizing the effect of test-manipulation strategies, researchers have proposed different algorithms to implement CAT with restricted revision options. In this article, we propose and evaluate a new method that implements CAT without any restriction on item review.

Zhang and Lin advanced the discussion of nonadditivity in data from a theoretical perspective and showed the adverse effects of nonadditivity on the estimation precision of VCs in 2016. Contributing to this line of research, the current article directs the discussion of nonadditivity from a theoretical perspective to a practical application and highlights the importance of detecting nonadditivity in G-theory applications. To this end, Tukey's test for nonadditivity is the only method to date that is appropriate for the typical single-facet G-theory design, in which a single observation is made per element within a facet. The current article evaluates the Type I and Type II error rates of Tukey's test. Results show that Tukey's test is satisfactory in controlling for falsely detecting nonadditivity when the data are actually additive and that it is generally powerful in detecting nonadditivity when it exists. Finally, the article demonstrates an application of Tukey's test in detecting nonadditivity in a judgmental study of educational standards and shows how Tukey's test results can be used to correct imprecision in the estimated VC in the presence of nonadditivity.

The widespread move to computerized test delivery has led to the development of new approaches to evaluating how examinees use testing time and to new metrics designed to provide evidence about the extent to which time limits impact performance. Much of the existing research is based on these types of observational metrics; relatively few studies use randomized experiments to evaluate the impact time limits on scores. Of those studies that do report on randomized experiments, none directly compare the experimental results to evidence from observational metrics to evaluate the extent to which these metrics are able to sensitively identify conditions in which time constraints actually impact scores. The present study provides such evidence based on data from a medical licensing examination.

We consider the use of item response theory in the estimation of item characteristics and student ability when multiple attempts are allowed but no explicit penalty is deducted for extra tries. This is common practice in online formative assessments, where the number of attempts is often unlimited. In these environments, some students may not always answer-until-correct, but may rather terminate a response process after one or more incorrect tries. We contrast the cases of graded and sequential item response models, both unidimensional models which do not explicitly account for factors other than ability. These approaches differ not only in terms of log-odds assumptions but, importantly, in terms of handling incomplete data. We explore the consequences of model misspecification through a simulation study and with four online homework data sets. Our results suggest that model selection is insensitive for complete data, but quite sensitive to whether missing responses are regarded as informative (of inability) or not (e.g., missing at random). Under realistic conditions, a sequential model with similar parametric degrees of freedom to a graded model can account for more response patterns and outperforms the latter in terms of model fit. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066803646

In this study, the most general CDM of the generalized deterministic input, noisy “and” gate (G-DINA) model was extended to a multilevel higher order CDM by embedding a multilevel structure into higher order latent traits. A series of simulations based on diverse factors was conducted to assess the quality of the parameter estimation.

The range of the location parameters had opposing effects on the recovery of the item and person parameters. Ignoring the multilevel structure in the data by fitting a single-level G-DINA model decreased the attribute classification accuracy and the precision of latent trait estimation. The number of measurement occasions had a substantial impact on latent trait estimation. Satisfactory model and person parameter recoveries could be achieved even when assumptions of the measurement invariance of the model parameters over time were violated. A longitudinal basic ability assessment is outlined to demonstrate the application of the new models.

Therefore, using standard item response theory models, which assume ignorable missing data, can yield biased parameter estimates so that examinees taking different sets of items to answer cannot be compared. To solve this fundamental problem, in this study the researchers utilized the specific objectivity of Rasch models by adopting the conditional maximum likelihood estimation (CMLE) and pairwise estimation (PE) methods to analyze ESI data, and conducted a series of simulations to demonstrate the advantages of the CMLE and PE methods over traditional estimation methods in recovering item parameters in ESI data.

However, when error-prone test scores are used as independent variables or right-hand-side controls, the estimation of such growth models can be substantially biased. This article introduces a simulation-extrapolation (SIMEX) method that corrects measurement error induced bias. The SIMEX method is applied to quantile regression, which is the basis of Student Growth Percentile, a descriptive growth model adopted in a number of states to diagnose and project student growth. A simulation study is conducted to demonstrate the performance of the SIMEX method in reducing bias and mean squared error in quantile regression with a mismeasured predictor. One of the simulation cases is based on longitudinal state assessment data. The analysis shows that measurement error differentially biases growth percentile results for students at different achievement levels and that the SIMEX method corrects such biases and closely reproduces conditional distributions of current test scores given past true scores. The potential applications and limitations of the method are discussed at the end of this paper with suggestions for further studies. © 2012 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871676234

However, there is a lack of research on the assessment of impact of interruptions at an individual level. We attempt to fill that void. We suggest four methodological approaches, primarily based on statistical hypothesis testing, linear regression, and item response theory, which can provide evidence on the individual-level impact of interruptions.

Five multidimensional CAT item selection procedures (minimum angle volume minimum error variance of the linear combination; minimum error variance of the composite score with optimized weight; and Kullback-Leibler information) were studied and compared with two methods for item exposure control (the Sympson-Hetter procedure and the fixed-rate procedure, the latter simply refers to putting a limit on the item exposure rate) using simulated data. The maximum priority index method was used for the content constraints. Results showed that the Sympson-Hetter procedure yielded better precision than the fixed-rate procedure but had much lower item pool usage and took more time. The five item selection procedures performed similarly under Sympson-Hetter. For the fixed-rate procedure, there was a trade-off between the precision of the ability estimates and the item pool usage: the five procedures had different patterns. It was found that (1) Kullback-Leibler had better precision but lower item pool usage (2) minimum angle and volume had balanced precision and item pool usage and (3) the two methods minimizing the error variance had the best item pool usage and comparable overall score recovery but less precision for certain domains.

Machine ratings were applied under three conditions: (a) both the training and test were conducted with the original data, (b) the training was modeled on the anonymized data, but the predictions were made on the original data, and (c) both the training and test were conducted on the anonymized text. The first condition served as the baseline for subsequent comparisons on the mean, standard deviation, and quadratic weighted kappa. With one exception, results on scoring scales in the range of 1-6 were not significantly different. The results on scales that were much wider did show significant differences.

Unfortunately, this model becomes difficult to manage when a polytomous item is graded by more than two raters. In this study, by adding random-effect parameters to the facets model, we propose a class of generalized rater models to account for the local dependence among multiple ratings and intrarater variation in severity. A series of simulations was conducted with the freeware WinBUGS to evaluate parameter recovery of the new models and consequences of ignoring the local dependence or intrarater variation in severity.

In taking up this issue, two different perspectives on educational measurement are contrasted: a metaphorical perspective and a classical perspective. Although the metaphorical perspective is more predominant, at present it provides no objective methods whereby the properties of a vertical scale can be validated. In contrast, when taking a classical perspective, the axioms of additive conjoint measurement can be used to test the hypothesis that the latent variable underlying a vertical scale is quantitative (supporting ratio or interval properties) rather than merely qualitative (supporting ordinal or nominal properties).

With these statistics and the saturated model serving as the basis, relative and absolute fit evaluation can be integrated to detect misspecification efficiently. © 2013 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879028758

Previous research indicates that equating results may not be accurate when group differences are large. This study compared the equating results of frequency estimation, chained equipercentile, item response theory (IRT) true-score, and IRT observed-score equating methods. Using mixed-format test data, equating results were evaluated for group differences ranging from 0 to .75 standard deviations. As group differences increased, equating results became increasingly biased and dissimilar across equating methods. Results suggest that the size of group differences, the likelihood that equating assumptions are violated, and the equating error associated with an equating method should be taken into consideration when choosing an equating method. © 2014 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896976788

The computer-based delivery mode brings with it certain advantages. One advantage is the ability to adapt the difficulty level of the test to the ability level of the test taker in what has been termed computerized adaptive testing (CAT). A second advantage is the ability to record not only the test taker's response to each item (i.e., question), but also the amount of time the test taker spends considering and answering each item. Combining these two advantages, various methods were explored for utilizing response time data in selecting appropriate items for an individual test taker. Four strategies for incorporating response time data were evaluated, and the precision of the final test-taker score was assessed by comparing it to a benchmark value that did not take response time information into account. While differences in measurement precision and testing times were expected, results showed that the strategies did not differ much with respect to measurement precision but that there were differences with regard to the total testing time.

Each examinee was rated in four skill domains: data gathering, communication-interpersonal skills, spoken English proficiency, and documentation proficiency. Conditional standard errors of measurement computed for single-take and multiple-take examinees indicated that ratings were of comparable precision for the two groups within each of the four skill domains; however, conditional errors were larger for low-scoring examinees regardless of retest status. In addition, on their first attempt multiple-take examinees exhibited less score consistency across the skill domains but on their second attempt their scores became more consistent. Further, the median correlation between scores on the four clinical skill domains and three external measures was .15 for multiple-take examinees on their first attempt but increased to .27 for their second attempt, a value, which was comparable to the median correlation of .26 for single-take examinees.

The outcomes known as slip and guess are included in the DINA model function representing the responses to the items. This study aimed to extend the DINA model by using the random-effect approach to allow examinees to have different probabilities of slipping and guessing. Two extensions of the DINA model were developed and tested to represent the random components of slipping and guessing. The first model assumed that a random variable can be incorporated in the slipping parameters to allow examinees to have different levels of caution. The second model assumed that the examinees' ability may increase the probability of a correct response if they have not mastered all of the required attributes of an item. The results of a series of simulations based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods showed that the model parameters and attribute-mastery profiles can be recovered relatively accurately from the generating models and that neglect of the random effects produces biases in parameter estimation.

It shows that frequency estimation equating can be used under circumstances when it is not normally used. To link theoretical results with practice, statistical methods are proposed for checking frequency estimation assumptions based on available data: observed-score distributions and item difficulty distributions of the forms. In addition to the conventional use of frequency estimation equating when the group abilities are similar, three situations are identified when the group abilities are dissimilar: (a) when the two forms and the observed conditional score distributions are similar the two forms and the observed conditional score distributions are similar (in this situation, the frequency estimation equating assumptions are likely to hold, and frequency estimation equating is appropriate); (b) when forms are similar but the observed conditional score distributions are not (in this situation, frequency estimation equating is not appropriate); and (c) when forms are not similar but the observed conditional score distributions are (frequency estimation equating is not appropriate).

Therefore, existing statistics (e.g., number of wrong-to-right ACs) used to detect examinees with aberrant ACs capitalize on the uncertainty, which may result in a large Type I error. In this article, the information about ACs is used only for the partitioning of administered items into two disjoint subtests: items where ACs did not occur, and items where ACs did occur. A new statistic is based on the difference in performance between these subtests (measured as Kullback-Leibler divergence between corresponding posteriors of latent traits), where, in order to avoid the uncertainty, only final responses are used.

In Scenario 1, referred to as rater comparability scoring and equating, the anchor-to-total correlation is often very high for the new form but moderate for the reference form. This may adversely affect the results of Tucker equating, especially if the new and reference form samples differ in ability. In Scenario 2, the new and reference form samples are randomly equivalent but the correlation between the anchor and total scores is low. When the correlation between the anchor and total scores is low, Tucker equating assumes that the new and reference form samples are similar in ability (which, with randomly equivalents groups, is the correct assumption). Thus Tucker equating should produce accurate results. Results indicated that in Scenario 1, the Tucker results were less accurate than the chained linear equating results.

However, cross-national differential item functioning (DIF) has been repeatedly documented. We ran a simulation study using national item parameters, which required trends to be computed separately for each country, to compare trend estimation performances to two linking methods employing international item parameters across several conditions. The trend estimates based on the national item parameters were more accurate than the trend estimates based on the international item parameters when cross-national DIF was present. Moreover, the use of fixed common item parameter calibrations led to biased trend estimates. The detection and elimination of DIF can reduce this bias but is also likely to increase the total error.

As a consequence, it is important to explore rational approaches to combine the information from different educational tests. For example, U.S. graduate schools usually receive both TOEFL iBT® scores and GRE® General scores of foreign applicants for admission; however, little guidance has been given to combine information from these two assessments, even though the relationships between such sections as GRE Verbal and TOEFL iBT Reading are obvious. In this study, principles are provided to explore the extent to which different assessments complement one another and are distinguishable. Augmentation approaches developed for individual tests are applied to provide an accurate evaluation of combined assessments. Because augmentation methods require estimates of measurement error and internal reliability data are unavailable, required estimates of measurement error are obtained from repeaters, examinees who took the same test more than once. Because repeaters are not representative of all examinees in typical assessments, minimum discriminant information adjustment techniques are applied to the available sample of repeaters to treat the effect of selection bias. To illustrate methodology, combining information from TOEFL iBT scores and GRE General scores is examined. Analysis suggests that information from the GRE General and TOEFL iBT assessments is complementary but not redundant, indicating that the two tests measure related but somewhat different constructs. The proposed methodology can be readily applied to other situations where multiple assessments are needed. © 2015 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930162475

The identity of these two matrices, however, is only valid in case of a correctly specified model.

The equality of both matrices can be tested with the so-called information matrix test as a general test of misspecification. This test can be adapted to item response models in order to evaluate the fit of single items and the fit of the whole scale. The performance of different versions of the test is compared in a simulation study with existing tests of model fit, among them thetest of Orlando and Thissen, the score test of local independence due to Glas and Suarez-Falcon, and the limited information approach of Maydeu-Olivares and Joe.

Measures are presented and described for decomposing the linear regression's prediction error variance into parts attributable to the true score variance and the error variances of the dependent variable and the predictor variable(s). These measures are demonstrated for regression situations reflecting a range of true score correlations and reliabilities and using one and two predictors. Simulation results also are presented which show that the measures of prediction error variance and its parts are generally well estimated for the considered ranges of true score correlations and reliabilities and for homoscedastic and heteroscedastic data. The final discussion considers how the decomposition might be useful for addressing additional questions about regression functions' prediction error variances. © 2012 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.,,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871689459

Test collusion may be described as large-scale sharing of test materials, including answers to test items. Current methods of detecting test collusion are based on statistics also used in answer-copying detection. Therefore, in computerized adaptive testing (CAT) these methods lose power because the actual test varies across examinees. This article addresses that problem by introducing a new approach that works in two stages: in Stage 1, test centers with an unusual distribution of a person-fit statistic are identified via Kullback-Leibler divergence; in Stage 2, examinees from identified test centers are analyzed further using the person-fit statistic, where the critical value is computed without data from the identified test centers. The approach is extremely flexible. One can employ any existing person-fit statistic. The approach can be applied to all major testing programs: paper-and-pencil testing (P&P), computer-based testing (CBT), multiple-stage testing (MST), and CAT. Also, the definition of test center is not limited by the geographic location (room, class, college) and can be extended to support various relations between examinees (from the same undergraduate college, from the same test-prep center, from the same group at a social network). The suggested approach was found to be effective in CAT for detecting groups of examinees with item pre-knowledge, meaning those with access (possibly unknown to us) to one or more subsets of items prior to the exam. © 2013 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879021869

There is a lack of research on this topic due to the novelty of the problem. This article is an attempt to fill that void. Several methods, primarily based on propensity score matching, linear regression, and item response theory, were suggested to determine the overall impact of the interruptions on the examinees' scores. A realistic simulation study shows that the suggested methods have satisfactory Type I error rate and power. Then the methods were applied to data from the Indiana Statewide Testing for Educational Progress-Plus (ISTEP+) test that experienced interruptions in 2013.

In this article, we illustrate how seemingly negligible amounts of functional form misfit, when systematic, can be associated with significant distortions of the score metric in vertical scaling contexts. Our analysis uses two- and three-parameter versions of Samejima's logistic positive exponent model (LPE) as a data generating model. Consistent with prior work, we find LPEs generally provide a better comparative fit to real item response data than traditional IRT models (2PL, 3PL). Further, our simulation results illustrate how 2PL- or 3PL-based vertical scaling in the presence of LPE-induced misspecification leads to an artificial growth deceleration across grades, consistent with that commonly seen in vertical scaling studies. The results raise further concerns about the use of standard IRT models in measuring growth, even apart from the frequently cited concerns of construct shift/multidimensionality across grades. © 2014 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902239326

Sometimes, however, item parameters are not invariant across different test administrations due to factors other than sampling error; this phenomenon is termed item parameter drift. Several methods have been developed to detect drifted items. However, most of the existing methods were designed to detect drifts in individual items, which may not be adequate for test characteristic curve-based linking or equating. One example is the item response theory-based true score equating, whose goal is to generate a conversion table to relate number-correct scores on two forms based on their test characteristic curves. This article introduces a stepwise test characteristic curve method to detect item parameter drift iteratively based on test characteristic curves without needing to set any predetermined critical values. Comparisons are made between the proposed method and two existing methods under the three-parameter logistic item response model through simulation and real data analysis. Results show that the proposed method produces a small difference in test characteristic curves between administrations, an accurate conversion table, and a good classification of drifted and nondrifted items and at the same time keeps a large amount of linking items. © 2015 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940886297

More specifically, this study examines (1) the consequences of model misfit on IRT item parameter estimates due to unintended minor item-level multidimensionality, and (2) whether a Projection IRT model can provide a useful remedy. A real-data example is used to illustrate the problem and also is used as a base model for a simulation study. The results suggest that ignoring item-level multidimensionality might lead to inflated item discrimination parameter estimates when the proportion of multidimensional test items to unidimensional test items is as low as 1:5. The Projection IRT model appears to be a useful tool for updating unidimensional item parameter estimates of multidimensional test items for a purified unidimensional interpretation.

Although the proposed method is computationally intensive, results from a simulation study show that the MC-SIMEX method improves latent regression coefficients and associated subpopulation achievement estimates.

Although intrajudge consistency feedback has often been provided to Angoff judges in practice, more evidence is needed to determine whether it achieves its intended effect. In this randomized experiment with 36 judges, non-numeric item-level intrajudge consistency feedback was provided to treatment-group judges after the first and second rounds of Angoff ratings. Compared to the judges in the control condition, those receiving the feedback significantly improved their intrajudge consistency, with the effect being stronger after the first round than after the second round. To examine whether this feedback has deleterious effects on between-judge consistency, I also examined interjudge consistency at the cut score level and the item level using generalizability theory. The results showed that without the feedback, cut score variability worsened; with the feedback, idiosyncratic item-level variability improved. These results suggest that non-numeric intrajudge consistency feedback achieves its intended effect and potentially improves interjudge consistency.

Appropriate methods of analyzing competence growth of students are needed to deal with those challenges and thereby obtain valid results. In this article, a pretest-posttest-posttest multivariate multilevel IRT model for repeated measures is introduced which is designed to address educational research questions according to a German research project. In this model, dependencies between repeated observations of the same students are considered not, as usual, by clustering observations within participants but rather by clustering observations within semesters. Estimation of the model is conducted within a Bayesian framework. Results indicate that competences grew over time. Gender, intelligence, motivation, and prior education could explain differences in the level of competence among business and economics students.

To ensure the validity of the results from these models, differential item functioning (DIF) in CDMs needs to be investigated. In this article, the Wald test is proposed to examine DIF in the context of CDMs. This study explored the effectiveness of the Wald test in detecting both uniform and nonuniform DIF in the DINA model through a simulation study. Results of this study suggest that for relatively discriminating items, the Wald test had Type I error rates close to the nominal level. Moreover, its viability was underscored by the medium to high power rates for most investigated DIF types when DIF size was large. Furthermore, the performance of the Wald test in detecting uniform DIF was compared to that of the traditional Mantel-Haenszel (MH) and SIBTEST procedures. The results of the comparison study showed that the Wald test was comparable to or outperformed the MH and SIBTEST procedures. Finally, the strengths and limitations of the proposed method and suggestions for future studies are discussed. © 2014 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896952280

An argument-based approach to validation suggests that the claims based on the test scores be outlined as an argument that specifies the inferences and supporting assumptions needed to get from test responses to score-based interpretations and uses. Validation then can be thought of as an evaluation of the coherence and completeness of this interpretation/use argument and of the plausibility of its inferences and assumptions. In outlining the argument-based approach to validation, this paper makes eight general points. First, it is the proposed score interpretations and uses that are validated and not the test or the test scores. Second, the validity of a proposed interpretation or use depends on how well the evidence supports the claims being made. Third, more-ambitious claims require more support than less-ambitious claims. Fourth, more-ambitious claims (e.g., construct interpretations) tend to be more useful than less-ambitious claims, but they are also harder to validate. Fifth, interpretations and uses can change over time in response to new needs and new understandings leading to changes in the evidence needed for validation. Sixth, the evaluation of score uses requires an evaluation of the consequences of the proposed uses; negative consequences can render a score use unacceptable. Seventh, the rejection of a score use does not necessarily invalidate a prior, underlying score interpretation. Eighth, the validation of the score interpretation on which a score use is based does not validate the score use. © 2013 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875066975

The estimation accuracy from the MCMC method was compared with those from the marginalized maximum likelihood estimation (MMLE) with the expectation-maximization algorithm in ConQuest and the sixth-order Laplace approximation estimation in HLM6. The results indicated that the estimation methods had significant effects on the bias of the testlet variance and ability variance estimation, the random error in the ability parameter estimation, and the bias in the item difficulty parameter estimation. The Laplace method best recovered the testlet variance while the MMLE best recovered the ability variance. The Laplace method resulted in the smallest random error in the ability parameter estimation while the MCMC method produced the smallest bias in item parameter estimates. Analyses of three real tests generally supported the findings from the simulation and indicated that the estimates for item difficulty and ability parameters were highly correlated across estimation methods.

Unfortunately, due to the high cost of convening multiple panels of content experts, standards often are based on the recommendation from a single panel of judges. This approach implicitly assumes that the variability across panels will be modest, but little evidence is available to support this assertion. This article examines the stability of Angoff standard setting results across panels. Data were collected for six independent standard setting exercises, with three panels participating in each exercise. The results show that although in some cases the panel effect is negligible, for four of the six data sets the panel facet represented a large portion of the overall error variance. Ignoring the often hidden panel/occasion facet can result in artificially optimistic estimates of the cut score stability. Results based on a single panel should not be viewed as a reasonable estimate of the results that would be found over multiple panels. Instead, the variability seen in a single panel can best be viewed as a lower bound of the expected variability when the exercise is replicated. © 2014 by the National Board of Medical Examiners.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902248988

As defined the Race to the Top program, these assessments are intended to yield a yearly summative score for accountability purposes. They must provide for both individual and group proficiency estimates and allow for the measurement of growth. They must accommodate students who vary their patterns of curricular exposure. Because they are meant to provide actionable information to teachers they must be instructionally sensitive, so item-operating characteristics can be expected to change relative to one another as a function of patterns of curricular exposure. This paper discusses methodology one can draw upon to tackle this ambitious collection of inferences. We consider a modeling framework that consists of an item response theory component and a population component, as the National Assessment of Educational Progress, and show how performance and growth could be expressed terms of expected performance on a market basket of tasks.

This was done for an external anchor design and a variation of a pretest design. The study also investigated whether a constrained mixture Rasch model could identify latent classes in such a way that one latent class represented high-stakes responding while the other represented low-stakes responding. The results indicated that for an external anchor design, the Rasch linking result was only biased when the motivation level differed between the subpopulations to which the anchor items were administered. However, the mixture Rasch model did not identify the classes representing low-stakes and high-stakes responding. When a pretest design was used to link the operational tests by means of a Rasch model, the linking result was found to be biased in each condition. Bias increased as percentage of students showing low-stakes responding to the anchor items increased.

I address these differences in language. van der Linden maintains that there are only two requirements for score equating. I maintain that the requirements he discards have practical utility and are testable. The score equity requirement proposed by Lord suggests that observed score equating was either unnecessary or impossible. Strong equity serves as the fulcrum for van der Linden's thesis. His proposed solution to the equity problem takes inequitable measures and aligns conditional error score distributions, resulting in a family of linking functions, one for each level of θ.

Standard item response theory (IRT) models fail to consider such testing behaviors. In this study, a new class of mixture IRT models was developed to account for such testing behavior in dichotomous and polytomous items, by assuming test-takers were composed of multiple latent classes and by adding a decrement parameter to each latent class to describe performance decline. Parameter recovery, effect of model misspecification, and robustness of the linearity assumption in performance decline were evaluated using simulations. It was found that the parameters in the new models were recovered fairly well by using the freeware WinBUGS; the failure to account for such behavior by fitting standard IRT models resulted in overestimation of difficulty parameters on items located toward the end of the test and overestimation of test reliability; and the linearity assumption in performance decline was rather robust.

However, when the speed of a test taker is not constant, this assumption will be violated. In this article we propose a conditional joint model for item responses and RTs, which incorporates a covariance structure to explain the local dependency between speed and accuracy. To obtain information about the population of test takers, the new model was embedded in the hierarchical framework proposed by van der Linden (). A fully Bayesian approach using a straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler was developed to estimate all parameters in the model. The deviance information criterion (DIC) and the Bayes factor (BF) were employed to compare the goodness of fit between the models with two different parameter structures. The Bayesian residual analysis method was also employed to evaluate the fit of the RT model. Based on the simulations, we conclude that (1) the new model noticeably improves the parameter recovery for both the item parameters and the examinees' latent traits when the assumptions of conditional independence between the item responses and the RTs are relaxed and (2) the proposed MCMC sampler adequately estimates the model parameters.

Haberman suggested a method based on classical test theory (CTT) to determine if subscores have added value over the total score. One way to interpret the method is that a subscore has added value only if it has a better agreement than the total score with the corresponding subscore on a parallel form. The focus of this article is on classification of the examinees into ""pass"" and ""fail"" (or master and nonmaster) categories based on subscores. A new CTT-based method is suggested to assess whether classification based on a subscore is in better agreement, than classification based on the total score, with classification based on the corresponding subscore on a parallel form. The method can be considered as an assessment of the added value of subscores with respect to classification. The suggested method is applied to data from several operational tests. The added value of subscores with respect to classification is found to be very similar, except at extreme cutscores, to their added value from a value-added analysis of Haberman. © 2014 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902288336

One practice that has traditionally relied on model parameter point estimates but may be improved by using posterior draws is the development of a common metric for two independently calibrated test forms. Before parameter estimates from independently calibrated forms can be compared, at least one form's estimates must be adjusted such that both forms share a common metric. Because this adjustment is estimated, there is a propagation of error effect when it is applied. This effect is typically ignored, which leads to overconfidence in the adjusted estimates; yet, when model parameter posterior draws are available, it may be accounted for with a simple sampling strategy. In this paper, it is shown using simulated data that the proposed sampling strategy results in adjusted posteriors with superior coverage properties than those obtained using traditional point-estimate-based methods. © 2011 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953033203

The comparisons were with respect to error variances, reliability of ability estimates and item usage through CATs simulated under nine test conditions of various practical constraints and item selection space. The results showed that F had an apparent precision advantage over STR and USTR under unconstrained item selection, but with very poor item usage. USTR reduced error variances for STR under various conditions, with small compromises in item usage.

The same methodology can be used to automate the formatting of the set of selected items into the actual test form. Three different cases are discussed: (i) computerized test forms in which the items are presented on a screen one at a time and only their optimal order has to be determined; (ii) paper forms in which the items need to be ordered and paginated and the typical goal is to minimize paper use; and (iii) published test forms with the same requirements but a more sophisticated layout (e.g., double-column print). For each case, a menu of possible test-form specifications is identified, and it is shown how they can be modeled as linear constraints using 0-1 decision variables.

Model parameters are initial probabilities of the skills, effects of learning objects on gaining and losing the skills, and careless error and lucky guess probabilities of the problems.

The AHM is a psychometric procedure for classifying examinees' test item responses into a set of attribute mastery patterns associated with different components from a cognitive model. The study was conducted in two steps. In step 1, three cognitive models were developed by reviewing selected literature in reading comprehension as well as research related to SAT Critical Reading. Then, the cognitive models were validated by having a sample of students think aloud as they solved each item. In step 2, psychometric analyses were conducted on the SAT critical reading cognitive models by evaluating the model-data fit between the expected and observed response patterns produced from two random samples of 2,000 examinees who wrote the items. The model that provided best data-model fit was then used to calculate attribute probabilities for 15 examinees to illustrate our diagnostic testing procedure.

Moreover, using empirical Bayes with an unstructured prior does not lead to extremely poor results as other prior-estimation method combinations do.

In the first condition the small samples differed randomly in ability from the target population. In the second condition the small samples were systematically different from the target population. Results showed that equating with small samples (e.g., N < 25 or 50) using either raw or smoothed score distributions led to considerable large random equating error (although smoothing reduced random equating error). Moreover, when the small samples were not representative of the target population, the amount of equating bias also was quite large. It is concluded that although presmoothing can reduce random equating error, it is not likely to reduce equating bias caused by using an unrepresentative sample.

Under various plausible models, this phenomenon can be explained in terms of the unreliability of predictor variables. Attributing overprediction to measurement error, however, is not fully satisfactory: Might the measurement errors in the predictor variables be systematic in part, and could they be reduced? The research hypothesis in the current study was that the overprediction of Latino and African-American performance occurs, at least in part, because these students are more likely than White students to attend high schools with fewer resources. The study provided some support for this hypothesis and showed that the prediction of college grades can be improved using information about high school socioeconomic status. An interesting peripheral finding was that grades provided by students' high schools were stronger predictors of FGPA than were students' self-reported high school grades. Correlations between the two types of high school grades (computed for each of 18 colleges) ranged from .59 to .85. © 2011 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959566415

However, real data are seldom normally distributed, causing this normal estimator to be inconsistent. A general estimator, which does not rely on the normality assumption, would be preferred, because it is asymptotically accurate regardless of the distribution of the data. In this article, an analytical formula for the standard error of linear observed-score equating, which characterizes the effect of nonnormality, is obtained under elliptical distributions. Using three large-scale real data sets as the populations, resampling studies are conducted to empirically evaluate the normal and general estimators of the standard error of linear observed-score equating. The effect of sample size (50, 100, 250, or 500) and equating method (chained linear, Tucker, or Levine observed-score equating) are examined.

However, simply averaging the domain scores ignores the fact that different domains have different score points, that scores from those domains are related, and that at different score points the relationship between overall score and domain score may be different. To report reliable and valid overall scores and domain scores, I investigated the performance of four methods using both real and simulation data: (a) the unidimensional IRT model; (b) the higher-order IRT model, which simultaneously estimates the overall ability and domain abilities; (c) the multidimensional IRT (MIRT) model, which estimates domain abilities and uses the maximum information method to obtain the overall ability; and (d) the bifactor general model. My findings suggest that the MIRT model not only provides reliable domain scores, but also produces reliable overall scores.

In addition, unlike the other models, there is no linear relationship assumed between overall score and domain scores.

The length of the anchor test was also varied to examine its effect on the three different equating methods. The three equating methods were compared to a criterion equating to obtain estimates of random equating error, bias, and root mean squared error (RMSE). Results showed that, for most studied conditions, chained linear equating produced fairly good equating results in terms of low bias and RMSE. Levine equating also produced low bias and RMSE in some conditions. Although the Tucker method always produced the lowest random equating error, it produced a larger bias and RMSE than either of the other equating methods. As noted in the literature, these results also suggest that either chained linear or Levine equating be used when new and old form samples differ on ability and/or when the anchor-to-total correlation is not very high. Finally, by testing the missing data assumptions of the three equating methods, this study also shows empirically why an equating method is more or less accurate under certain conditions. © 2010 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953704287

When comparisons are made between scores from two or more assessments that are built to different specifications and are administered to different populations under different conditions, the validity of the comparisons hinges on untestable assumptions. For example, tests administered across different disability groups or tests administered to different language groups produce scores for which implicit linkings are presumed to hold. Presumed linking makes use of extreme assumptions to produce links between scores on tests in the absence of common test material or equivalent groups of test takers. These presumed linkings lead to dubious interpretations.

We introduce a DIF model, called the random item mixture (RIM), that is based on a Rasch model with random item difficulties (besides the common random person abilities). In addition, a mixture model is assumed for the item difficulties such that the items may belong to one of two classes: a DIF or a non-DIF class. The crucial difference between the DIF class and the non-DIF class is that the item difficulties in the DIF class may differ according to the observed person groups while they are equal across the person groups for the items from the non-DIF class. Statistical inference for the RIM is carried out in a Bayesian framework. The performance of the RIM is evaluated using a simulation study in which it is compared with traditional procedures, like the likelihood ratio test, the Mantel-Haenszel procedure and the standardized p -DIF procedure. In this comparison, the RIM performs better than the other methods. Finally, the usefulness of the model is also demonstrated on a real life data set. © 2010 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951865531

Here it is shown that a latent class model motivated by signal detection theory (SDT) is a natural candidate for the first level of the HRM, the rater model.

In addition, the IRT true score equating is also compared to the chained equipercentile equating, and we observe that the sample variances for the chained equipercentile equating are much smaller than the variances for the IRT true score equating with an exception at the low scores. © 2012 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862896456

This paper extended previous research to polytomous IRT models. A simulation study was conducted to explore the performance of posterior predictive model checking in evaluating different aspects of fit for unidimensional graded response models. A variety of discrepancy measures (test-level, item-level, and pair-wise measures) that reflected different threats to applications of graded IRT models to performance assessments were considered. Results showed that posterior predictive model checking exhibited adequate power in detecting different aspects of misfit for graded IRT models when appropriate discrepancy measures were used. Pair-wise measures were found more powerful in detecting violations of the unidimensionality and local independence assumptions. © 2011 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953054614

The model fit indices used in this study include PARSCALE's G2, Orlando and Thissen's S - X2 and S - G2, and Stone's χ2* and G2*. To investigate the relative performance of the fit statistics at the item level, we conducted two simulation studies: Type I error and power studies. We evaluated the performance of the item fit indices for various conditions of test length, sample size, and IRT models. Among the competing measures, the summed score-based indices S - X2 and S - G2 were found to be the sensible and efficient choice for assessing model fit for mixed format data. These indices performed well, particularly with short tests. The pseudo-observed score indices, χ2* and G2*, showed inflated Type I error rates in some simulation conditions. Consistent with the findings of current literature, the PARSCALE's G2 index was rarely useful, although it provided reasonable results for long tests. © 2010 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956757182

CDMs are developed for the purpose of identifying the mastery or nonmastery of multiple fine-grained attributes or skills required for solving problems in a domain. For CDMs to receive wider use, researchers and practitioners need to understand the basic properties of these models. The article focuses on one CDM, the deterministic inputs, noisy "" and"" gate (DINA) model, and the invariance property of its parameters. Using simulated data involving different attribute distributions, the article demonstrates that the DINA model parameters are absolutely invariant when the model perfectly fits the data. An additional example involving different ability groups illustrates how noise in real data can contribute to the lack of invariance in these parameters. Some practical implications of these findings are discussed. © 2010 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953743410

Reality is complicated, but our models need to be simple in order to be manageable. We assume that attributes are invariant over some conditions of observation, and once we do that we need some way of accounting for the variability in observed scores over these conditions of observation. We relegate this inconvenient variability to errors of measurement. The seriousness of errors of measurement depends on the intended interpretations and uses of the scores and the context in which they are used. Errors are too large if they interfere with the intended interpretations and uses, and otherwise are acceptable. The errors of measurement have to be small compared to the tolerance for error, and errors that are too large have to be controlled in some way. We have several ways of doing this. We can redefine the attribute of interest, we can standardize the assessments and leave the attribute alone, and/or we can sample the relevant performance domain more thoroughly. It is particularly important to control the larger sources of error. If a source of error (systematic or random) is small compared to the dominant sources of error for a testing procedure, it can generally be ignored. © 2011 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953042880

Using data from a large-scale exam, this study investigated the use of anchor CR item rescoring (known as trend scoring) in the context of classical equating methods. Four linking designs were examined: an anchor with only MC items, a mixed-format anchor test containing both MC and CR items; a mixed-format anchor test incorporating common CR item rescoring; and an equivalent groups (EG) design with CR item rescoring, thereby avoiding the need for an anchor test. Designs using either MC items alone or a mixed anchor without CR item rescoring resulted in much larger bias than the other two designs. The EG design with trend scoring resulted in the smallest bias, leading to the smallest root mean squared error value. © 2010 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953798762

These items require people to make subjective judgments, and these subjective judgments usually involve randomness. To account for this randomness, Wang, Wilson, and Shih proposed the random-effect rating scale model in which the threshold parameters are treated as random effects rather than fixed effects. In the present study, the Wang et al. model was further extended to incorporate slope parameters and embed the new model within the framework of multilevel nonlinear mixed-effect models. This was done so that (1) no efforts are needed to derive parameter estimation procedures, and (2) existing computer programs can be applied directly. A brief simulation study was conducted to ascertain parameter recovery using the SAS NLMIXED procedure. An empirical example regarding students' interest in learning science is presented to demonstrate the implications and applications of the new model. © 2011 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84055189159

We propose a procedure for assessing the practical equivalence of conversions developed for the same set of test questions but administered under different measurement conditions. This procedure assesses whether the use of separate conversions for each condition has a desirable or undesirable effect. We distinguish effects due to differences in difficulty from effects due to rounding conventions. The proposed procedure provides objective empirical information that assists in deciding to report a common conversion for a set of items or a different conversion for the set of items when the set is administered under different measurement conditions. To illustrate the use of the procedure, we consider the case where a scrambled test form is used along with a base test form. If section order effects are detected between the scrambled and base forms, a decision needs to be made whether to report a single common conversion for both forms or to report separate conversions. © 2012 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859112293
