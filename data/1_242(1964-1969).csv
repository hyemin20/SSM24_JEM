Various measures of gain have been advanced to measure the amount learned, but all have subsequently been found inadequate. It is hypothesized that the relationship between test scores and knowledge is curvilinear. A rationale is presented for the curvilinear nature of the posited relationship and for the fit of the model to classroom learning. From hypothetical data conforming to the model expressed in a mathematical formula, it was shown that it is possible for the final examination to be the best indicant of amount learned, even though individuals are not equal in proficiency at the beginning of the learning task. Based upon several considerations it was concluded that, at present, the best indicant of amount learned in many classroom situations is the final examination. Copyright © 1969, Wiley Blackwell.

This implies an IQ X Creativity interactive effect on achievement. If an IQ threshold exists, regression weights for IQ X Creativity interactive predictors should be statistically significant when included in multiple regression equations. Three creativity factor scores were estimated and were each multiplied by IQ to define three moderated or interactive predictor variables. A slight though statistically significant increase in validity resulted by adding the moderated variables to IQ and the three factor scores in multiple regression equations. Thus, there was weak support for the existence of an IQ threshold, but the regression of achievement on creativity decreased rather than increased with higher IQ. Copyright © 1969, Wiley Blackwell.

An analysis was then made of the types of misspellings which are used by writers of spelling items. A set of error‐generation rules was developed and a computer program, The MISSPELLER, was written. A sample of words was fed into the computer and a list of misspelled words, separated into previously defined error categories, was created.

In the bright condition (n= 37) Ss were informed that the responses were those of a child reading far above his age level, while in the dull condition (n= 35) Ss were informed that the responses were those of a child reading far below his age level.

The latter, termed the pentachotomous‐logical (P‐L), provided scores with slightly higher internal consistency and a frequency distribution which is not so significantly skewed as the others and which provides greater spread among extreme positive and negative scores. Use of the P‐L scoring weights would facilitate the psychological interpretation of the MTAI. However, conclusion that the P‐L scoring key is an improvement must be tempered by the fact that an expected increase in construct validity was not found. Copyright © 1969, Wiley Blackwell.

With data from three samples, the MATAP exhibited unsatisfactory internal consistency and test‐retest reliability. Significant, but low, positive correlations were found with the Illinois Art Ability Test, the Kuder Artistic scale, and biographical items concerning art training and interests. The MATAP correlated negatively with the Child Test of Esthetic Sensitivity. Most art related course grades and all American College Testing Program scores were not significantly related to the MATAP.

To evaluate the effect of different educational experiences and orientations, college test performance, corrected for level of high school performance, was correlated with amount of work taken in specific course areas, grades awarded in these areas, and inventory items relating to background and educational philosophy. The results support the notion of greater differentiation in the residual intellectual growth of males. Deviations from predicted growth on the college test performance indices were relatively uncorrelated with each other and more correlated with specific experiences for males than for females.

One moderator was found that consistently identified a group of predictable individuals regardless of both sex and the three creative achievement criteria. This moderator was a modification of the Drews sociability scale and it indicated that those individuals who had little or no inclination towards social functions tended to be considerably more predictable than the remainder of the sample or when the group was taken as a whole. Within the low social groups, girls appeared to be somewhat more predictable than boys on two of the three creative achievement criteria, however the greatest discrepancy appeared in the writing criterion where the girls were substantially more predictable.

Overall differences among test administration methods on multiple‐choice test scores were not significant for either grade group; although for both grades, the mean score under the group administration method was highest. On short‐answer exercises, third‐graders performed significantly better in individual interview administrations.

The CTMM was administered twice to all students; once employing the usual answer marking format contained in the test booklet and once employing a separate answer sheet. A counterbalanced design was used to control for order effects. The mean raw differences between marking format conditions decreased from 23.67 to 10.79 to 3.32 for students in grades one through three respectively, indicating that the need for the test booklet marking format decreases sharply as the grade level of the Ss increases.

This sample of students was randomly divided into two equal subgroups. Item difficulty indices were calculated for each of the two subsamples for each of the two forms of the test. Data obtained from the first subsample were used to evaluate the published ordering of items of Forms A and B of the PPVT and to reorder the items according to the empirically derived item difficulties. The second subsample was used as a cross‐validation sample to evaluate the empirically derived reordering of items. The results of the cross‐validation of the reordering indicate a substantial and significant increase in the validity of the item orderings for this subset of items on both forms of the PPVT. Therefore, this new ordering may yield a more accurate estimate of the intelligence of average and above students in the fourth‐, fifth‐, and sixth‐grades than the present, published ordering of items.

More traditional, a norm‐referenced measure is used to identify an individual's performance in relation to the performance of others on the same measure. A criterion‐referenced test is used to identify an individual's status with respect to an established standard of performance. This discussion examines the implications of these two approaches to measurement, particularly criterion‐referenced measurement, with respect to variability, item construction, reliability, validity, item analysis, reporting, and interpretation.

The authors point out that regression equations derived in this way can be used to plan lessons in which all problems would be of approximately equal difficulty, and thus could have maximally reliable entrance or pretests, and might also be concerned with only one factor or topic. Lessons could be arranged from easiest to most difficult by using the regression equation to predict lesson difficulty. It is thought that the size of the multiple correlation between difficulty level and the structural variables may be an indication of how well the micro‐ and mini‐objectives of the instructional system have been formulated.

Data from previous studies and from a predominantly black university were analyzed. Results tend to indicate that high school grades do not consistently make the greatest contribution in predicting college grades of black students, perhaps particularly of men, whereas they do for whites. Unreliability of grade reporting, invalidity of grades in high school, restriction in range due to selection processes, and intergroup differences in personality characteristics were advanced to explain this phenomenon. Further research on this problem was suggested in view of the fact that many selective institutions are relying heavily on high school grades in their selection of black students.
