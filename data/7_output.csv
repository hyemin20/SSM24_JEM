Domingue B.W.; Kanopka K.; Stenhaug B.; Soland J.; Kuhfeld M.; Wise S.; Piech C.,Variation in Respondent Speed and its Implications: Evidence from an Adaptive Testing Scenario,2021,58.0,"The more frequent collection of response time data is leading to an increased need for an understanding of how such data can be included in measurement models. Models for response time have been advanced, but relatively limited large-scale empirical investigations have been conducted. We take advantage of a large data set from the adaptive NWEA MAP Growth Reading Assessment to shed light on emergent features of response time behavior. We identify two behaviors in particular. The first, response acceleration, is a reduction in response time for responses that occur later in the assessment. We note that such reductions are heterogeneous as a function of estimated ability (lower ability estimates are associated with larger increases in acceleration) and that reductions in response time lead to lower accuracy relative to expectation for lower ability students. The second is within-person variation in the association between time usage and accuracy. Idiosyncratic within-person changes in response time have inconsistent implications for accuracy; in some cases additional response time predicts higher accuracy but in other cases additional response time predicts declines in accuracy. These findings have implications for models that incorporate response time and accuracy. Our approach may be useful in other studies of adaptive testing data. © 2021 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['Variation', 'Respondent', 'Speed', 'Implications', 'Evidence', 'Adaptive', 'Testing', 'Scenario']","['variation', 'respondent', 'speed', 'implications', 'evidence', 'adaptive', 'testing', 'scenario']",variation respondent speed implications evidence adaptive testing scenario
Baldwin P.; Yaneva V.; Mee J.; Clauser B.E.; Ha L.A.,Using Natural Language Processing to Predict Item Response Times and Improve Test Construction,2021,58.0,"In this article, it is shown how item text can be represented by (a) 113 features quantifying the text's linguistic characteristics, (b) 16 measures of the extent to which an information-retrieval-based automatic question-answering system finds an item challenging, and (c) through dense word representations (word embeddings). Using a random forests algorithm, these data then are used to train a prediction model for item response times and predicted response times then are used to assemble test forms. Using empirical data from the United States Medical Licensing Examination, we show that timing demands are more consistent across these specially assembled forms than across forms comprising randomly-selected items. Because an exam's timing conditions affect examinee performance, this result has implications for exam fairness whenever examinees are compared with each other or against a common standard. © 2020 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['Natural', 'Language', 'Processing', 'Predict', 'Item', 'Response', 'Times', 'improve', 'Test', 'construction']","['natural', 'language', 'processing', 'predict', 'item', 'response', 'times', 'improve', 'test', 'construction']",natural language processing predict item response times improve test construction
Lim H.; Choe E.M.; Han K.T.,A Residual-Based Differential Item Functioning Detection Framework in Item Response Theory,2022,59.0,"Differential item functioning (DIF) of test items should be evaluated using practical methods that can produce accurate and useful results. Among a plethora of DIF detection techniques, we introduce the new Residual DIF (RDIF) framework, which stands out for its accessibility without sacrificing efficacy. This framework consists of three item response theory (IRT) residual statistics: (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), and (Formula presented.). We conducted a simulation study with a 40-item test to assess the performance of RDIF in comparison with the Mantel-Haenszel, logistic regression, and IRT-based likelihood ratio test methods. Even when analyzing small sample sizes, the results revealed (Formula presented.) to be the most robust DIF detection statistic with strict control of Type I error across all simulated conditions when paired with the purification procedure. Also, (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) proved to be powerful indicators of uniform and nonuniform DIF, respectively. Therefore, (Formula presented.) should serve as the primary flagging criterion, whereas (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) best serve as indicators of DIF type. An empirical DIF study also showed that the RDIF framework could perform satisfactorily with real data from a large-scale assessment. Overall, the RDIF framework demonstrated its potential as a new standard for IRT-based DIF detection methodology. © 2022 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['ResidualBased', 'Differential', 'Item', 'Functioning', 'Detection', 'Framework', 'Item', 'Response', 'Theory']","['residualbased', 'differential', 'item', 'functioning', 'detection', 'framework', 'item', 'response', 'theory']",residualbased differential item functioning detection framework item response theory
Liao X.; Bolt D.M.; Kim J.-S.,Curvilinearity in the Reference Composite and Practical Implications for Measurement,2024,,"Item difficulty and dimensionality often correlate, implying that unidimensional IRT approximations to multidimensional data (i.e., reference composites) can take a curvilinear form in the multidimensional space. Although this issue has been previously discussed in the context of vertical scaling applications, we illustrate how such a phenomenon can also easily occur within individual tests. Measures of reading proficiency, for example, often use different task types within a single assessment, a feature that may not only lead to multidimensionality, but also an association between item difficulty and dimensionality. Using a latent regression strategy, we demonstrate through simulations and empirical analysis how associations between dimensionality and difficulty yield a nonlinear reference composite where the weights of the underlying dimensions change across the scale continuum according to the difficulties of the items associated with the dimensions. We further show how this form of curvilinearity produces systematic forms of misspecification in traditional unidimensional IRT models (e.g., 2PL) and can be better accommodated by models such as monotone-polynomial or asymmetric IRT models. Simulations and a real-data example from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study—Kindergarten are provided for demonstration. Some implications for measurement modeling and for understanding the effects of 2PL misspecification on measurement metrics are discussed. © 2024 The Author(s).

Kim S.Y.; Lee W.-C.,Several Variations of Simple-Structure MIRT Equating,2023,60.0,"The current study proposed several variants of simple-structure multidimensional item response theory equating procedures. Four distinct sets of data were used to demonstrate feasibility of proposed equating methods for two different equating designs: a random groups design and a common-item nonequivalent groups design. Findings indicated some notable differences between the multidimensional and unidimensional approaches when data exhibited evidence for multidimensionality. In addition, some of the proposed methods were successful in providing equating results for both section-level and composite-level scores, which has not been achieved by most of the existing methodologies. The traditional method of using a set of quadrature points and weights for equating turned out to be computationally intensive, particularly for the data with higher dimensions. The study suggested an alternative way of using the Monte-Carlo approach for such data. This study also proposed a simple-structure true-score equating procedure that does not rely on a multivariate observed-score distribution. © 2022 The Authors.

Li D.,Assessing the Impact of Equating Error on Group Means and Group Mean Differences,2022,59.0,"Equating error is usually small relative to the magnitude of measurement error, but it could be one of the major sources of error contributing to mean scores of large groups in educational measurement, such as the year-to-year state mean score fluctuations. Though testing programs may routinely calculate the standard error of equating (SEE), the commonly used summary statistics of SEE are not direct quantifications of the impact of equating error on group means. This article proposed summary statistics that directly quantify the impact of equating error on group means or group mean differences and provided empirical and analytical methods to estimate these statistics.

Wise S.L.; Kuhfeld M.R.,Using Retest Data to Evaluate and Improve Effort-Moderated Scoring,2021,58.0,"There has been a growing research interest in the identification and management of disengaged test taking, which poses a validity threat that is particularly prevalent with low-stakes tests. This study investigated effort-moderated (E-M) scoring, in which item responses classified as rapid guesses are identified and excluded from scoring. Using achievement test data composed of test takers who were quickly retested and showed differential degrees of disengagement, three basic findings emerged. First, standard E-M scoring accounted for roughly one-third of the score distortion due to differential disengagement. Second, a modified E-M scoring method that used more liberal time thresholds performed better—accounting for two-thirds or more of the distortion. Finally, the inability of E-M scoring to account for all of the score distortion suggests the additional presence of nonrapid item responses that reflect less-than-full engagement by some test takers. © 2020 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['Retest', 'Data', 'evaluate', 'improve', 'EffortModerated', 'Scoring']","['retest', 'data', 'evaluate', 'improve', 'effortmoderated', 'scoring']",retest data evaluate improve effortmoderated scoring
Setzer J.C.; Cheng Y.; Liu C.,Classification Accuracy and Consistency of Compensatory Composite Test Scores,2023,60.0,"Test scores are often used to make decisions about examinees, such as in licensure and certification testing, as well as in many educational contexts. In some cases, these decisions are based upon compensatory scores, such as those from multiple sections or components of an exam. Classification accuracy and classification consistency are two psychometric characteristics of test scores that are often reported when decisions are based on those scores, and several techniques currently exist for estimating both accuracy and consistency. However, research on classification accuracy and consistency on compensatory test scores is scarce. This study demonstrates two techniques that can be used to estimate classification accuracy and consistency when test scores are used in a compensatory manner. First, a simulation study demonstrates that both methods provide very similar results under the studied conditions. Second, we demonstrate how the two methods could be used with a high-stakes licensure exam. © 2023 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['Classification', 'Accuracy', 'Consistency', 'Compensatory', 'Composite', 'Test', 'Scores']","['classification', 'accuracy', 'consistency', 'compensatory', 'composite', 'test', 'scores']",classification accuracy consistency compensatory composite test scores
Goldhammer F.; Kroehne U.; Hahnel C.; Naumann J.; De Boeck P.,Does Timed Testing Affect the Interpretation of Efficiency Scores?—A GLMM Analysis of Reading Components,2024,,"The efficiency of cognitive component skills is typically assessed with speeded performance tests. Interpreting only effective ability or effective speed as efficiency may be challenging because of the within-person dependency between both variables (speed-ability tradeoff, SAT). The present study measures efficiency as effective ability conditional on speed by controlling speed experimentally. Item-level time limits control the stimulus presentation time and the time window for responding (timed condition). The overall goal was to examine the construct validity of effective ability scores obtained from untimed and timed condition by comparing the effects of theory-based item properties on item difficulty. If such effects exist, the scores reflect how well the test-takers were able to cope with the theory-based requirements. A German subsample from PISA 2012 completed two reading component skills tasks (i.e., word recognition and semantic integration) with and without item-level time limits. Overall, the included linguistic item properties showed stronger effects on item difficulty in the timed than the untimed condition. In the semantic integration task, item properties explained the time required in the untimed condition. The results suggest that effective ability scores in the timed condition better reflect how well test-takers were able to cope with the theoretically relevant task demands. © 2024 The Authors.

Madison M.J.; Wind S.A.; Maas L.; Yamaguchi K.; Haab S.,A One-Parameter Diagnostic Classification Model with Familiar Measurement Properties,2024,,"Diagnostic classification models (DCMs) are psychometric models designed to classify examinees according to their proficiency or nonproficiency of specified latent characteristics. These models are well suited for providing diagnostic and actionable feedback to support intermediate and formative assessment efforts. Several DCMs have been developed and applied in different settings. This study examines a DCM with functional form similar to the 1-parameter logistic item response theory model. Using data from a large-scale mathematics education research study, we demonstrate and prove that the proposed DCM has measurement properties akin to the Rasch and one-parameter logistic item response theory models, including sum score sufficiency, item-free and person-free measurement, and invariant item and person ordering.

Gerasimova D.,Argument-Based Approach to Validity: Developing a Living Document and Incorporating Preregistration,2024,61.0,"I propose two practical advances to the argument-based approach to validity: developing a living document and incorporating preregistration. First, I present a potential structure for the living document that includes an up-to-date summary of the validity argument. As the validation process may span across multiple studies, the living document allows future users of the instrument to access the entire validity argument in one place. Second, I describe how preregistration can be incorporated in the argument-based approach. Specifically, I distinguish between two types of preregistration: preregistration of the argument and preregistration of validation studies. Preregistration of the argument is a single preregistration that is specified for the entire validation process. Here, the developer specifies interpretations, uses, and claims before collecting validity evidence. Preregistration of a validation study refers to preregistering a single validation study that aims to evaluate a set of claims. Here, the developer describes study components (e.g., research design, data collection, data analysis, etc.), before collecting data. Both preregistration types have the potential to reduce the risk of bias (e.g., hindsight and confirmation biases), as well as to allow others to evaluate the risk of bias and, hence, calibrate confidence, in the developer's evaluation of the validity argument. © 2024 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['ArgumentBased', 'Approach', 'Validity', 'develop', 'Living', 'Document', 'incorporate', 'Preregistration']","['argumentbased', 'approach', 'validity', 'develop', 'living', 'document', 'incorporate', 'preregistration']",argumentbased approach validity develop living document incorporate preregistration

Expected item/test information indexes at various levels are proposed and plotted to provide diagnostic information on items and tests. The expected test information indexes for EAP scores may be difficult to compute due to a typical test's vast number of item response patterns. The relationships of item/test information with discrimination parameters of statements, standard error, and reliability estimates of trait score estimates are discussed and demonstrated using real data.

Castellano K.E.; McCaffrey D.F.; Lockwood J.R.,An Exploration of an Improved Aggregate Student Growth Measure Using Data from Two States,2023,60.0,"The simple average of student growth scores is often used in accountability systems, but it can be problematic for decision making. When computed using a small/moderate number of students, it can be sensitive to the sample, resulting in inaccurate representations of growth of the students, low year-to-year stability, and inequities for low-incidence groups. An alternative designed to address these issues is to use an Empirical Best Linear Prediction (EBLP), which is a weighted average of growth score data from other years and/or subjects. We apply both approaches to two statewide datasets to answer empirical questions about their performance. The EBLP outperforms the simple average in accuracy and cross-year stability with the exception that accuracy was not necessarily improved for very large districts in one of the states. In such exceptions, we show a beneficial alternative may be to use a hybrid approach in which very large districts receive the simple average and all others receive the EBLP. We find that adding more growth score data to the computation of the EBLP can improve accuracy, but not necessarily for larger schools/districts. We review key decision points in aggregate growth reporting and in specifying an EBLP weighted average in practice. © 2023 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['Exploration', 'improved', 'Aggregate', 'Student', 'Growth', 'measure', 'Data', 'state']","['exploration', 'improved', 'aggregate', 'student', 'growth', 'measure', 'data', 'state']",exploration improved aggregate student growth measure data state
Baldwin P.; Clauser B.E.,Historical Perspectives on Score Comparability Issues Raised by Innovations in Testing,2022,59.0,"While score comparability across test forms typically relies on common (or randomly equivalent) examinees or items, innovations in item formats, test delivery, and efforts to extend the range of score interpretation may require a special data collection before examinees or items can be used in this way—or may be incompatible with common examinee or item designs altogether. When comparisons are necessary under these nonroutine conditions, forms still must be connected by something and this article focuses on these form-invariant connective somethings.

We propose the nonparametric root expected proportion squared difference (REPSD) index that evaluates the statistical significance of composite group DIF for relatively small focal groups stemming from multicategorical focal variables, with decisions of statistical significance based on quasi-exact p values obtained from Monte Carlo permutations of the DIF statistic under the null distribution. We conduct a simulation to evaluate conditions under which the index produces acceptable Type I error and power rates, as well as an application to a school district assessment.

Deribo T.; Kroehne U.; Goldhammer F.,Model-Based Treatment of Rapid Guessing,2021,58.0,"The increased availability of time-related information as a result of computer-based assessment has enabled new ways to measure test-taking engagement. One of these ways is to distinguish between solution and rapid guessing behavior. Prior research has recommended response-level filtering to deal with rapid guessing. Response-level filtering can lead to parameter bias if rapid guessing depends on the measured trait or (un-)observed covariates. Therefore, a model based on Mislevy and Wu (1996) was applied to investigate the assumption of ignorable missing data underlying response-level filtering. The model allowed us to investigate different approaches to treating response-level filtered responses in a single framework through model parameterization. The study found that lower-ability test-takers tend to rapidly guess more frequently and are more likely to be unable to solve an item they guessed on, indicating a violation of the assumption of ignorable missing data underlying response-level filtering. Further ability estimation seemed sensitive to different approaches to treating response-level filtered responses. Moreover, model-based approaches exhibited better model fit and higher convergent validity evidence compared to more naïve treatments of rapid guessing. The results illustrate the need to thoroughly investigate the assumptions underlying specific treatments of rapid guessing as well as the need for robust methods. © 2021 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['ModelBased', 'Treatment', 'Rapid', 'Guessing']","['modelbased', 'treatment', 'rapid', 'guessing']",modelbased treatment rapid guessing
Yuan L.; Huang Y.; Li S.; Chen P.,Online Calibration in Multidimensional Computerized Adaptive Testing with Polytomously Scored Items,2023,60.0,"Online calibration is a key technology for item calibration in computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and has been widely used in various forms of CAT, including unidimensional CAT, multidimensional CAT (MCAT), CAT with polytomously scored items, and cognitive diagnostic CAT. However, as multidimensional and polytomous assessment data become more common, only a few published reports focus on online calibration in MCAT with polytomously scored items (P-MCAT). Therefore, standing on the shoulders of the existing online calibration methods/designs, this study proposes four new P-MCAT online calibration methods and two new P-MCAT online calibration designs and conducts two simulation studies to evaluate their performance under varying conditions (i.e., different calibration sample sizes and correlations between dimensions). Results show that all of the newly proposed methods can accurately recover item parameters, and the adaptive designs outperform the random design in most cases.

Despite the popular usages of multiple measures, there is little research on classification consistency and accuracy of multiple measures. Accordingly, this study introduces an approach to estimate classification consistency and accuracy indices for multiple measures under four possible decision rules: (1) complementary, (2) conjunctive, (3) compensatory, and (4) pairwise combinations of the three. The current study uses the IRT-recursive-based approach with the simple-structure multidimensional IRT model (SS-MIRT) to estimate the classification consistency and accuracy for multiple measures. Theoretical formulations of the four decision rules with a binary decision (Pass/Fail) are presented. The estimation procedures are illustrated using an empirical data example based on SS-MIRT. In addition, this study applies the estimation procedures to the unidimensional IRT (UIRT) context, considering that UIRT is practically used more. This application shows that the proposed procedure of classification consistency and accuracy could be used with a UIRT model for individual measures as an alternative method of SS-MIRT. © 2022 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['estimate', 'Classification', 'Accuracy', 'Consistency', 'Indices', 'Multiple', 'Measures', 'Simple', 'structure', 'MIRT']","['estimate', 'classification', 'accuracy', 'consistency', 'indices', 'multiple', 'measures', 'simple', 'structure', 'mirt']",estimate classification accuracy consistency indices multiple measures simple structure mirt

To explore the potential application of this framework to computerized adaptive testing (CAT), the present study investigated the utility of the RDIFR statistic both as an index for detecting uniform DIF of pretest items in CAT and as a direct measure of the effect size of uniform DIF. Extensive CAT simulations revealed RDIFR to have well-controlled Type I error and slightly higher power to detect uniform DIF compared with CATSIB, especially when pretest items were calibrated using fixed-item parameter calibration. Moreover, RDIFR accurately estimated the amount of uniform DIF irrespective of the presence of impact.

Ranger J.; Kuhn J.-T.; Wolgast A.,Robust Estimation of Ability and Mental Speed Employing the Hierarchical Model for Responses and Response Times,2021,58.0,"Van der Linden's hierarchical model for responses and response times can be used in order to infer the ability and mental speed of test takers from their responses and response times in an educational test. A standard approach for this is maximum likelihood estimation. In real-world applications, the data of some test takers might be partly irregular, resulting from rapid guessing or item preknowledge. The maximum likelihood estimator is not robust against contamination with irregular data. In this article, we propose a robust estimator of ability and mental speed. The estimator consists of two steps. In the first step, the mental speed is estimated with the estimator of Gervini and Yohai that ignores outlying response times. In the second step, the ability is estimated with an M-estimator that down weights unusual responses given at unusual response times. This is achieved by combining the hard-rejection weights of Gervini and Yohai with the M-estimator suggested by Croux and Haesbroeck for the logistic regression model. The proposed estimator is consistent, almost as efficient as the maximum likelihood estimator in uncontaminated data and robust in contaminated data. The performance of the estimator is analyzed in a simulation study and an empirical example. © 2020 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['robust', 'Estimation', 'Ability', 'Mental', 'Speed', 'Employing', 'Hierarchical', 'Responses', 'Response', 'Times']","['robust', 'estimation', 'ability', 'mental', 'speed', 'employing', 'hierarchical', 'responses', 'response', 'times']",robust estimation ability mental speed employing hierarchical responses response times
Tijmstra J.; Bolsinova M.; Liaw Y.-L.; Rutkowski L.; Rutkowski D.,Sensitivity of the RMSD for Detecting Item-Level Misfit in Low-Performing Countries,2020,57.0,"Although the root-mean squared deviation (RMSD) is a popular statistical measure for evaluating country-specific item-level misfit (i.e., differential item functioning [DIF]) in international large-scale assessment, this paper shows that its sensitivity to detect misfit may depend strongly on the proficiency distribution of the considered countries. Specifically, items for which most respondents in a country have a very low (or high) probability of providing a correct answer will rarely be flagged by the RMSD as showing misfit, even if very strong DIF is present. With many international large-scale assessment initiatives moving toward covering a more heterogeneous group of countries, this raises issues for the ability of the RMSD to detect item-level misfit, especially in low-performing countries that are not well-aligned with the overall difficulty level of the test. This may put one at risk of incorrectly assuming measurement invariance to hold, and may also inflate estimated between-country difference in proficiency.

Henninger M.,A Novel Partial Credit Extension Using Varying Thresholds to Account for Response Tendencies,2021,58.0,"Item Response Theory models with varying thresholds are essential tools to account for unknown types of response tendencies in rating data. However, in order to separate constructs to be measured and response tendencies, specific constraints have to be imposed on varying thresholds and their interrelations. In this article, a multidimensional extension of a Partial Credit Model using a sum-to-zero constraint for varying thresholds is proposed. The new model allows us to flexibly account for response tendencies and to model covariations between varying thresholds that are commonly found in empirical data. The model's ability to estimate different types of response tendencies under various data structures is shown in a simulation study. An illustrative multicountry analysis demonstrates that differences between respondents in terms of their response tendencies exist and can be captured by the new model. Furthermore, it is well suited to account for extreme and mid response styles, but also to accommodate unknown, previously unmodeled, response tendencies. Therewith, the sum-to-zero model can be considered a suitable candidate to examine the types response tendencies in rating data and to account for biases in construct measures due to response tendencies. © 2020 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['Novel', 'Partial', 'Credit', 'Extension', 'vary', 'Thresholds', 'Account', 'Response', 'tendency']","['novel', 'partial', 'credit', 'extension', 'vary', 'thresholds', 'account', 'response', 'tendency']",novel partial credit extension vary thresholds account response tendency

In this paper, we proposed to use an innovative item response time model as a cohesive missing data model to account for the two most common item nonresponses: not-reached items and omitted items. In particular, the new model builds on a behavior process interpretation: a person chooses to skip an item if the required effort exceeds the implicit time the person allocates to the item (Lee & Ying, 2015; Wolf, Smith, & Birnbaum, 1995), whereas a person fails to reach the end of the test due to lack of time. This assumption was verified by analyzing the 2015 PISA computer-based mathematics data. Simulation studies were conducted to further evaluate the performance of the proposed Bayesian estimation algorithm for the new model and to compare the new model with a recently proposed “speed-accuracy + omission” model (Ulitzsch, von Davier, & Pohl, 2019). Results revealed that all model parameters could recover properly, and inadequately accounting for missing data caused biased item and person parameter estimates. © 2020 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['Response', 'Time', 'Process', 'NotReached', 'Omitted', 'Items']","['response', 'time', 'process', 'notreached', 'omitted', 'items']",response time process notreached omitted items
Liu J.; Becker K.,The Impact of Cheating on Score Comparability via Pool-Based IRT Pre-equating,2022,59.0,"For any testing programs that administer multiple forms across multiple years, maintaining score comparability via equating is essential. With continuous testing and high-stakes results, especially with less secure online administrations, testing programs must consider the potential for cheating on their exams. This study used empirical and simulated data to examine the impact of item exposure and prior knowledge on the estimation of item difficulty and test taker's ability via pool-based IRT preequating. Raw-to-theta transformations were derived from two groups of test takers with and without possible prior knowledge of exposed items, and these were compared to a criterion raw to theta transformation. Results indicated that item exposure has a large impact on item difficulty, not only altering the difficulty of exposed items, but also altering the difficulty of unexposed items. Item exposure makes test takers with prior knowledge appear more able. Further, theta estimation bias for test takers without prior knowledge increases when more test takers with possible prior knowledge are in the calibration population. Score inflation occurs for test takers with and without prior knowledge, especially for those with lower abilities. © 2022 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['Impact', 'cheating', 'Score', 'Comparability', 'PoolBased', 'IRT', 'preequate']","['impact', 'cheating', 'score', 'comparability', 'poolbased', 'irt', 'preequate']",impact cheating score comparability poolbased irt preequate

Wyse A.E.; McBride J.R.,A Framework for Measuring the Amount of Adaptation of Rasch-based Computerized Adaptive Tests,2021,58.0,A key consideration when giving any computerized adaptive test (CAT) is how much adaptation is present when the test is used in practice. This study introduces a new framework to measure the amount of adaptation of Rasch-based CATs based on looking at the differences between the selected item locations (Rasch item difficulty parameters) of the administered items and target item locations determined from provisional ability estimates at the start of each item. Several new indices based on this framework are introduced and compared to previously suggested measures of adaptation using simulated and real test data. Results from the simulation indicate that some previously suggested indices are not as sensitive to changes in item pool size and the use of constraints as the new indices and may not work as well under different item selection rules. The simulation study and real data example also illustrate the utility of using the new indices to measure adaptation at both a group and individual level. Discussion is provided on how one may use several of the indices to measure adaptation of Rasch-based CATs in practice. © 2020 by the National Council on Measurement in Education,"['Framework', 'measure', 'Amount', 'Adaptation', 'Raschbased', 'Computerized', 'Adaptive', 'test']","['framework', 'measure', 'amount', 'adaptation', 'raschbased', 'computerized', 'adaptive', 'test']",framework measure amount adaptation raschbased computerized adaptive test
Huang S.; Chung S.; Falk C.F.,Modeling Response Styles in Cross-Classified Data Using a Cross-Classified Multidimensional Nominal Response Model,2024,,"In this study, we introduced a cross-classified multidimensional nominal response model (CC-MNRM) to account for various response styles (RS) in the presence of cross-classified data. The proposed model allows slopes to vary across items and can explore impacts of observed covariates on latent constructs. We applied a recently developed variant of the Metropolis-Hastings Robbins-Monro (MH-RM) algorithm to address the computational challenge of estimating the proposed model. To demonstrate our new approach, we analyzed empirical student evaluation of teaching (SET) data collected from a large public university with three models: a CC-MNRM with RS, a CC-MNRM with no RS, and a multilevel MNRM with RS. Results indicated that the three models led to different inferences regarding the observed covariates. Additionally, in the example, ignoring/incorporating RS led to changes in student substantive scores, while the instructor substantive scores were less impacted. Misspecifying the cross-classified data structure resulted in apparent changes on instructor scores. To further evaluate the proposed modeling approach, we conducted a preliminary simulation study and observed good parameter and score recovery.

Qiao X.; Jiao H.; He Q.,"Multiple-Group Joint Modeling of Item Responses, Response Times, and Action Counts with the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson Distribution",2023,60.0,"Multiple group modeling is one of the methods to address the measurement noninvariance issue. Traditional studies on multiple group modeling have mainly focused on item responses. In computer-based assessments, joint modeling of response times and action counts with item responses helps estimate the latent speed and action levels in addition to latent ability. These two new data sources can also be used to further address the measurement noninvariance issue. One challenge, however, is to correctly model action counts which can be underdispersed, overdispersed, or equidispersed in real data sets. To address this, we adopted the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution that accounts for different types of dispersion in action counts and incorporated it in the multiple group joint modeling of item responses, response times, and action counts. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method was used for model parameter estimation. To illustrate an application of the proposed model, an empirical data analysis was conducted using the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015 collaborative problem-solving items where potential measurement noninvariance issue existed between gender groups. Results indicated that Conway-Maxwell-Poisson model yielded better model fit than alternative count data models such as negative binomial and Poisson models.

Jones P.; Tong Y.; Liu J.; Borglum J.; Primoli V.,Score Comparability between Online Proctored and In-Person Credentialing Exams,2022,59.0,"This article studied two methods to detect mode effects in two credentialing exams. In Study 1, we used a “modal scale comparison approach,” where the same pool of items was calibrated separately, without transformation, within two TC cohorts (TC1 and TC2) and one OP cohort (OP1) matched on their pool-based scale score distributions. The calibrations from all three groups were used to score the TC2 cohort, designated the validation sample. The TC1 item parameters and TC1-based thetas and pass rates were more like the native TC2 values than the OP1-based values, indicating mode effects, but the score and pass/fail decision differences were small. In Study 2, we used a “cross-modal repeater approach” in which test takers who failed their first attempt in one modality took the test again in either the same or different modality. The two pairs of repeater groups (TC → TC: TC → OP, and OP → OP: OP → TC) were matched exactly on their first attempt scores. Results showed increased pass rate and greater score variability in all conditions involving OP, with mode effects noticeable in both the TC → OP condition and less-strongly in the OP → TC condition.

In conjunction with the answers to the items, previous studies have used descriptive statistics and arbitrary thresholds to identify student knowledge profiles with the CRIs. Whereas this approach overlooked the measurement error of the observed item responses and indices, we address this by proposing a factor mixture model that integrates a latent class model to detect student subgroups and a measurement model to control for student ability and confidence level. Applying the model to 773 seventh graders' responses to an algebra test, where some items were related to new material that had not been taught in class, we found two subgroups: (1) students who had high confidence in answering items involving the new material; and (2) students who had low confidence in answering items involving the new material but higher general self-confidence than the first group. We regressed the posterior probability of the group membership on gender, prior achievement, and preview behavior and found preview behavior a significant factor associated with the membership.

Becker B.; Weirich S.; Goldhammer F.; Debeer D.,Controlling the Speededness of Assembled Test Forms: A Generalization to the Three-Parameter Lognormal Response Time Model,2023,60.0,"When designing or modifying a test, an important challenge is controlling its speededness. To achieve this, van der Linden (2011a, 2011b) proposed using a lognormal response time model, more specifically the two-parameter lognormal model, and automated test assembly (ATA) via mixed integer linear programming. However, this approach has a severe limitation, in that the two-parameter lognormal model lacks a slope parameter. This means that the model assumes that all items are equally speed sensitive. From a conceptual perspective, this assumption seems very restrictive. Furthermore, various other empirical studies and new data analyses performed by us show that this assumption almost never holds in practice. To overcome this shortcoming, we bring together the already frequently used three-parameter lognormal model for response times, which contains a slope parameter, and the ATA approach for controlling speededness by van der Linden. Using multiple empirically based illustrations, the proposed extension is illustrated, including complete and documented R code. Both the original van der Linden approach and our newly proposed approach are available to practitioners in the freely available R package eatATA. © 2023 The Authors.

The resulting speed parameters and model residuals are often analyzed for evidence of anomalous test-taking behavior associated with fast and poorly fitting response time patterns. Extending this model, we demonstrate the connection between the existing LNRT model parameters and the “level” component of profile similarity, and we define two new parameters for the LNRT model representing profile “dispersion” and “shape.” We show that while the LNRT model measures level (speed), profile dispersion and shape are conflated in model residuals, and that distinguishing them provides meaningful and useful parameters for identifying anomalous testing behavior. Results from data in a situation where many test-takers gained preknowledge of test items revealed that profile shape, not currently measured in the LNRT model, was the most sensitive response time index to the abnormal test-taking behavior patterns.

Different approaches exist for estimating this relationship, that either rely on specific study designs or on specific assumptions. This paper aims to add to the toolbox of approaches for estimating this relationship. We propose the intraindividual speed-ability-relation (ISAR) model, which relies on nonstationarity of speed and ability over the course of the test. The ISAR model explicitly models intraindividual change in ability and speed within a test and assesses the intraindividual relation of speed and ability by evaluating the relationship of both latent change variables. Model estimation is good, when there are interindividual differences in speed and ability changes in the data. In empirical data from PISA, we found that the intraindividual relationship between speed and ability is not universally negative for all individuals and varies across different competence domains and countries.

Kim R.Y.; Yoo Y.J.,Cognitive Diagnostic Multistage Testing by Partitioning Hierarchically Structured Attributes,2023,60.0,"In cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs), a set of fine-grained attributes is required to characterize complex problem solving and provide detailed diagnostic information about an examinee. However, it is challenging to ensure reliable estimation and control computational complexity when The test aims to identify the examinee's attribute profile in a large-scale map of attributes. To address this problem, this study proposes a cognitive diagnostic multistage testing by partitioning hierarchically structured attributes (CD-MST-PH) as a multistage testing for CDM. In CD-MST-PH, multiple testlets can be constructed based on separate attribute groups before testing occurs, which retains the advantages of multistage testing over fully adaptive testing or the on-the-fly approach. Moreover, testlets are offered sequentially and adaptively, thus improving test accuracy and efficiency. An item information measure is proposed to compute the discrimination power of an item for each attribute, and a module assembly method is presented to construct modules anchored at each separate attribute group. Several module selection indices for CD-MST-PH are also proposed by modifying the item selection indices used in cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing.

When used for formative assessment, the alignment of task difficulty with proficiency increases the chance that teachers can derive useful feedback from assessment data. The application of CAT to formative assessment in the classroom, however, is hindered by the large number of different items used for the whole class; the required familiarization with a large number of test items puts a significant burden on teachers. An improved CAT procedure for group-based testing is presented, which uses simultaneous automated test assembly to impose a limit on the number of items used per group. The proposed linear model for simultaneous adaptive item selection allows for full adaptivity and the accommodation of constraints on test content. The effectiveness of the group-based CAT is demonstrated with real-world items in a simulated adaptive test of 3,000 groups of test-takers, under different assumptions on group composition. Results show that the group-based CAT maintained the efficiency of CAT, while a reduction in the number of used items by one half to two-thirds was achieved, depending on the within-group variance of proficiencies. © 2020 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['simultaneous', 'Constrained', 'Adaptive', 'Item', 'Selection', 'GroupBased', 'Testing']","['simultaneous', 'constrained', 'adaptive', 'item', 'selection', 'groupbased', 'testing']",simultaneous constrained adaptive item selection groupbased testing
Cho S.-J.; Goodwin A.; Naveiras M.; Salas J.,Differential and Functional Response Time Item Analysis: An Application to Understanding Paper versus Digital Reading Processes,2024,61.0,"Despite the growing interest in incorporating response time data into item response models, there has been a lack of research investigating how the effect of speed on the probability of a correct response varies across different groups (e.g., experimental conditions) for various items (i.e., differential response time item analysis). Furthermore, previous research has shown a complex relationship between response time and accuracy, necessitating a functional analysis to understand the patterns that manifest from this relationship. In this study, response time data are incorporated into an item response model for two purposes: (a) to examine how individuals' speed within an experimental condition affects their response accuracy on an item, and (b) to detect the differences in individuals' speed between conditions in the presence of within-condition effects. For these two purposes, by-variable smooth functions are employed to model differential and functional response time effects by experimental condition for each item. This model is illustrated using an empirical data set to describe the effect of individuals' speed on their reading comprehension ability in two experimental conditions of reading medium (paper vs. digital) by item. A simulation study showed that the recovery of parameters and by-variable smooth functions of response time was satisfactory, and that the type I error rate and power of the test for the by-variable smooth function of response time were acceptable in conditions similar to the empirical data set. In addition, the proposed method correctly identified the range of response time where between-condition differences in the effect of response time on the probability of a correct response were accurate. © 2024 The Authors.

Given theoretical and methodological advances that propose hypothesis about change in one or multiple processes, analytical methods for longitudinal data have been developed that provide researchers with various options for analyzing change over time. In this paper, we revisit several latent growth curve models that may be considered to answer questions about repeated measures of continuous variables, which may be operationalised as time varying covariates or outcomes.

Study design and setting
To illustrate each of the models discussed and how to interpret parameter estimates, we present examples of each method discussed using cognitive and blood pressure measures from a longitudinal study of ageing, the OCTO Twin Study.

Puhan G.; Kim S.,Score Comparability Issues with At-Home Testing and How to Address Them,2022,59.0,"As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, at-home testing has become a popular delivery mode in many testing programs. When programs offer at-home testing to expand their service, the score comparability between test takers testing remotely and those testing in a test center is critical. This article summarizes statistical procedures that could be used to evaluate potential mode effects at both the item level and the total score levels.

van Laar S.; Braeken J.,Random Responders in the TIMSS 2015 Student Questionnaire: A Threat to Validity?,2022,59.0,"The low-stakes character of international large-scale educational assessments implies that a participating student might at times provide unrelated answers as if s/he was not even reading the items and choosing a response option randomly throughout. Depending on the severity of this invalid response behavior, interpretations of the assessment results are at risk of being invalidated. Not much is known about the prevalence nor impact of such random responders in the context of international large-scale educational assessments. Following a mixture item response theory (IRT) approach, an initial investigation of both issues is conducted for the Confidence in and Value of Mathematics/Science (VoM/VoS) scales in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2015 student questionnaire.

Han S.; Kang H.-A.,Online Monitoring of Test-Taking Behavior Based on Item Responses and Response Times,2023,60.0,"The study presents multivariate sequential monitoring procedures for examining test-taking behaviors online. The procedures monitor examinee's responses and response times and signal aberrancy as soon as significant change is identifieddetected in the test-taking behavior. The study in particular proposes three schemes to track different indicators of a test-taking mode—the observable manifest variables, latent trait variables, and measurement likelihood. For each procedure, sequential sampling strategies are presented to implement online monitoring. Numerical experimentation based on simulated data suggests that the proposed procedures demonstrate adequate performance. The procedures identified examinees with aberrant behaviors with high detection power and timeliness, while maintaining error rates reasonably small. Experimental application to real data also suggested that the procedures have practical relevance to real assessments.

Bulut O.; Gorgun G.; Karamese H.,Incorporating Test-Taking Engagement into Multistage Adaptive Testing Design for Large-Scale Assessments,2023,,"The use of multistage adaptive testing (MST) has gradually increased in large-scale testing programs as MST achieves a balanced compromise between linear test design and item-level adaptive testing. MST works on the premise that each examinee gives their best effort when attempting the items, and their responses truly reflect what they know or can do. However, research shows that large-scale assessments may suffer from a lack of test-taking engagement, especially if they are low stakes. Examinees with low test-taking engagement are likely to show noneffortful responding (e.g., answering the items very rapidly without reading the item stem or response options). To alleviate the impact of noneffortful responses on the measurement accuracy of MST, test-taking engagement can be operationalized as a latent trait based on response times and incorporated into the on-the-fly module assembly procedure. To demonstrate the proposed approach, a Monte-Carlo simulation study was conducted based on item parameters from an international large-scale assessment. The results indicated that the on-the-fly module assembly considering both ability and test-taking engagement could minimize the impact of noneffortful responses, yielding more accurate ability estimates and classifications. Implications for practice and directions for future research were discussed. © 2023 The Authors.

Moses T.,Linking and Comparability across Conditions of Measurement: Established Frameworks and Proposed Updates,2022,59.0,"One result of recent changes in testing is that previously established linking frameworks may not adequately address challenges in current linking situations. Test linking through equating, concordance, vertical scaling or battery scaling may not represent linkings for the scores of tests developed to measure constructs differently for different examinees, or tests that are administered in different modes and data collection designs. This article considers how previously proposed linking frameworks might be updated to address more recent testing situations. The first section summarizes the definitions and frameworks described in previous test linking discussions. Additional sections consider some sources of more disparate approaches to test development and administrations, as well as the implications of these for test linking. Possibilities for reflecting these features in an expanded test linking framework are proposed that encourage limited comparability, such as comparability that is restricted to subgroups or to the conditions of a linking study when a linking is produced, or within, but not across tests or test forms when an empirical linking based on examinee data is not produced.

Karatoprak Ersen R.; Lee W.-C.,Pretest Item Calibration in Computerized Multistage Adaptive Testing,2023,60.0,"The purpose of this study was to compare calibration and linking methods for placing pretest item parameter estimates on the item pool scale in a 1-3 computerized multistage adaptive testing design in terms of item parameter recovery. Two models were used: embedded-section, in which pretest items were administered within a separate module, and embedded-items, in which pretest items were distributed across operational modules. The calibration methods were separate calibration with linking (SC) and fixed calibration (FC) with three parallel approaches under each (FC-1 and SC-1; FC-2 and SC-2; and FC-3 and SC-3). The FC-1 and SC-1 used only operational items in the routing module to link pretest items. The FC-2 and SC-2 also used only operational items in the routing module for linking, but in addition, the operational items in second stage modules were freely estimated. The FC-3 and SC-3 used operational items in all modules to link pretest items. The third calibration approach (i.e., FC-3 and SC-3) yielded the best results. For all three approaches, SC outperformed FC in all study conditions which were module length, sample size and examinee distributions. © 2023 National Council on Measurement in Education.","['Pretest', 'Item', 'Calibration', 'Computerized', 'Multistage', 'Adaptive', 'Testing']","['pretest', 'item', 'calibration', 'computerized', 'multistage', 'adaptive', 'testing']",pretest item calibration computerized multistage adaptive testing
Joo S.-H.; Lee P.,Detecting Differential Item Functioning Using Posterior Predictive Model Checking: A Comparison of Discrepancy Statistics,2022,59.0,"This study proposes a new Bayesian differential item functioning (DIF) detection method using posterior predictive model checking (PPMC). Item fit measures including infit, outfit, observed score distribution (OSD), and Q1 were considered as discrepancy statistics for the PPMC DIF methods. The performance of the PPMC DIF method was evaluated via a Monte Carlo simulation manipulating sample size, DIF size, DIF type, DIF percentage, and subpopulation trait distribution. Parametric DIF methods, such as Lord's chi-square and Raju's area approaches, were also included in the simulation design in order to compare the performance of the proposed PPMC DIF methods to those previously existing. Based on Type I error and power analysis, we found that PPMC DIF methods showed better-controlled Type I error rates than the existing methods and comparable power to detect uniform DIF.

Thompson W.J.; Nash B.; Clark A.K.; Hoover J.C.,Using Simulated Retests to Estimate the Reliability of Diagnostic Assessment Systems,2023,60.0,"As diagnostic classification models become more widely used in large-scale operational assessments, we must give consideration to the methods for estimating and reporting reliability. Researchers must explore alternatives to traditional reliability methods that are consistent with the design, scoring, and reporting levels of diagnostic assessment systems. In this article, we describe and evaluate a method for simulating retests to summarize reliability evidence at multiple reporting levels. We evaluate how the performance of reliability estimates from simulated retests compares to other measures of classification consistency and accuracy for diagnostic assessments that have previously been described in the literature, but which limit the level at which reliability can be reported. Overall, the findings show that reliability estimates from simulated retests are an accurate measure of reliability and are consistent with other measures of reliability for diagnostic assessments. We then apply this method to real data from the Examination for the Certificate of Proficiency in English to demonstrate the method in practice and compare reliability estimates from observed data.

This study considers and evaluates an alternative approach for computing (Formula presented.) values and other factors associated with collapsing tables of observed and expected numbers (OE tables), which can affect flagging items. Results suggest that collapsing OE tables requires careful consideration of a trade-off between power and empirical type I error rate. Concurrent collapsing of score categories would be preferred over separate collapsing for its procedural simplicity, minimal effect of choice of a minimum cell value on empirical type I error rates, and reasonable type I error rates even for the most sparse condition in the study. For separate collapsing, a smaller minimum cell value is recommended as OE tables possess more sparseness (e.g., longer test lengths and smaller sample sizes) if inflated type I error rates are more of a concern in detecting items for misfit based on the (Formula presented.) index. If it is more important to identify misfit items, the study results recommend using a larger minimum cell value for collapsing. © 2022 The Authors.

Jin K.-Y.; Siu W.-L.; Huang X.,Exploring the Impact of Random Guessing in Distractor Analysis,2022,59.0,"Multiple-choice (MC) items are widely used in educational tests. Distractor analysis, an important procedure for checking the utility of response options within an MC item, can be readily implemented in the framework of item response theory (IRT). Although random guessing is a popular behavior of test-takers when answering MC items, none of the existing IRT models for distractor analysis have considered the influence of random guessing in this process. In this article, we propose a new IRT model to distinguish the influence of random guessing from response option functioning. A brief simulation study was conducted to examine the parameter recovery of the proposed model. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the new model was applied to the mathematics tests of the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE) from 2015 to 2019. The results of empirical analyses suggest that the complexity of item contents is a key factor in inducing students’ random guessing.

DeCarlo L.T.,On Joining a Signal Detection Choice Model with Response Time Models,2021,58.0,"In a signal detection theory (SDT) approach to multiple choice exams, examinees are viewed as choosing, for each item, the alternative that is perceived as being the most plausible, with perceived plausibility depending in part on whether or not an item is known. The SDT model is a process model and provides measures of item difficulty, item discrimination, and the relative plausibility of each alternative. It is shown how to incorporate information from response times into the model, which has potential benefits for estimation and also offers a way to study underlying processes. The SDT model is joined with a lognormal response time (RT) model in a manner similar to that used in hierarchical models. In addition, a mixture extension of the RT model is joined in a novel way with the SDT choice model, using the idea that the probability of “knowing” in the SDT model might be related to the probability of working in one of two speed states in the mixture RT model. A semiparametric version of the mixture RT model is also used to assess robustness.

van der Linden W.J.; Belov D.I.,A Statistical Test for the Detection of Item Compromise Combining Responses and Response Times,2023,60.0,"A test of item compromise is presented which combines the test takers' responses and response times (RTs) into a statistic defined as the number of correct responses on the item for test takers with RTs flagged as suspicious. The test has null and alternative distributions belonging to the well-known family of compound binomial distributions, is simple to calculate, and has results that are easy to interpret. It also demonstrated nearly perfect power for the detection of compromise with no more than 10 test takers with preknowledge of the more difficult and discriminating items in a set of empirical examples. For the easier and less discriminating items, the presence of some 20 test takers with preknowledge still sufficed.

Kwon T.Y.; Huggins-Manley A.C.; Templin J.; Zheng M.,Modeling Hierarchical Attribute Structures in Diagnostic Classification Models with Multiple Attempts,2024,61.0,"In classroom assessments, examinees can often answer test items multiple times, resulting in sequential multiple-attempt data. Sequential diagnostic classification models (DCMs) have been developed for such data. As student learning processes may be aligned with a hierarchy of measured traits, this study aimed to develop a sequential hierarchical DCM (sequential HDCM), which combines a sequential DCM with the HDCM, and investigate classification accuracy of the model in the presence of hierarchies when multiple attempts are allowed in dynamic assessment. We investigated the model's impact on classification accuracy when hierarchical structures are correctly specified, misspecified, or overspecified. The results indicate that (1) a sequential HDCM accurately classified students as masters and nonmasters when the data had a hierarchical structure; (2) a sequential HDCM produced similar or slightly higher classification accuracy than nonhierarchical sequential LCDM when the data had hierarchical structures; and (3) the misspecification of the hierarchical structure of the data resulted in lower classification accuracy when the misspecified model had fewer attribute profiles than the true model. We discuss limitations and make recommendations on using the proposed model in practice.

Grochowalski J.H.; Hendrickson A.,Detecting Group Collaboration Using Multiple Correspondence Analysis,2023,60.0,"Test takers wishing to gain an unfair advantage often share answers with other test takers, either sharing all answers (a full key) or some (a partial key). Detecting key sharing during a tight testing window requires an efficient, easily interpretable, and rich form of analysis that is descriptive and inferential. We introduce a detection method based on multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) that identifies test takers with unusual response similarities. The method simultaneously detects multiple shared keys (partial or full), plots results, and is computationally efficient as it requires only matrix operations. We describe the method, evaluate its detection accuracy under various simulation conditions, and demonstrate the procedure on a real data set with known test-taking misbehavior. The simulation results showed that the MCA method had reasonably high power under realistic conditions and maintained the nominal false-positive level, except when the group size was very large or partial shared keys had more than 50% of the items. The real data analysis illustrated visual detection procedures and inference about the item responses possibly shared in the key, which was likely shared among 91 test takers, many of whom were confirmed by nonstatistical investigation to have engaged in test-taking misconduct. © 2023 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['Detecting', 'Group', 'Collaboration', 'multiple', 'Correspondence', 'Analysis']","['detecting', 'group', 'collaboration', 'multiple', 'correspondence', 'analysis']",detecting group collaboration multiple correspondence analysis

In this paper, the multigroup multidimensional Rasch model is repurposed for modeling data originating from various versions of a culturally responsive assessment and for analyzing such data to compute comparable scores.

Guo J.; Xu X.; Xin T.,A Note on Latent Traits Estimates under IRT Models with Missingness,2023,60.0,"Missingness due to not-reached items and omitted items has received much attention in the recent psychometric literature. Such missingness, if not handled properly, would lead to biased parameter estimation, as well as inaccurate inference of examinees, and further erode the validity of the test. This paper reviews some commonly used IRT based models allowing missingness, followed by three popular examinee scoring methods, including maximum likelihood estimation, maximum a posteriori, and expected a posteriori. Simulation studies were conducted to compare these examinee scoring methods across these commonly used models in the presence of missingness. Results showed that all the methods could infer examinees' ability accurately when the missingness is ignorable. If the missingness is nonignorable, incorporating those missing responses would improve the precision in estimating abilities for examinees with missingness, especially when the test length is short. In terms of examinee scoring methods, expected a posteriori method performed better for evaluating latent traits under models allowing missingness.

However, the two sources of information are historically analyzed and interpreted separately, and diagnostic process information is often underused.

This application addresses (a) the joint modeling of students' pretest and posttest item responses and game-based processes described by indicators of misconceptions; (b) integration of gameplay information when gauging the intervention effect of an educational game; (c) relationships among game-based misconception, pretest initial status, and pre-to-post change; and (d) nesting of students within schools, a common aspect in multisite research. We also demonstrate how to structure the data and set up the model to enable our proposed application, and how our application compares to three other approaches to analyzing gameplay and assessment data.

Study 2 was designed based on a real multidimensional assessment. In addition, a MCAT was simulated as a baseline design to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed M-MST design in each study. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed ATA algorithms and routing rule can generate M-MSTs with a good-quality control and the same or even better ability estimation results than the MCAT given the same condition. This demonstrates the advantage of using M-MST for multidimensional assessment especially for the one that needs to satisfy many nonstatistical constraints. © 2022 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['Automated', 'Test', 'Assembly', 'Routing', 'Rule', 'Multistage', 'Adaptive', 'Testing', 'Multidimensional', 'Item', 'Response', 'Theory']","['automated', 'test', 'assembly', 'routing', 'rule', 'multistage', 'adaptive', 'testing', 'multidimensional', 'item', 'response', 'theory']",automated test assembly routing rule multistage adaptive testing multidimensional item response theory
Hong M.; Rebouças D.A.; Cheng Y.,Robust Estimation for Response Time Modeling,2021,58.0,"Response time has started to play an increasingly important role in educational and psychological testing, which prompts many response time models to be proposed in recent years. However, response time modeling can be adversely impacted by aberrant response behavior. For example, test speededness can cause response time to certain items to deviate from the hypothesized model. In this article, we introduce a robust estimation approach when estimating a respondent's working speed under the log-normal model by down-weighting aberrant response times. A simulation study is carried out to compare the performance of two weighting schemes and a real data example is provided to showcase the use of the new robust estimation method.

Lee S.; Han S.; Choi S.W.,A Bayesian Moderated Nonlinear Factor Analysis Approach for DIF Detection under Violation of the Equal Variance Assumption,2024,61.0,"Research has shown that multiple-indicator multiple-cause (MIMIC) models can result in inflated Type I error rates in detecting differential item functioning (DIF) when the assumption of equal latent variance is violated. This study explains how the violation of the equal variance assumption adversely impacts the detection of nonuniform DIF and how it can be addressed through moderated nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA) model via Bayesian estimation approach to overcome limitations from the restrictive assumption. The Bayesian MNLFA approach suggested in this study better control Type I errors by freely estimating latent factor variances across different groups. Our experimentation with simulated data demonstrates that the BMNFA models outperform the existing MIMIC models, in terms of Type I error control as well as parameter recovery. The results suggest that the MNLFA models have the potential to be a superior choice to the existing MIMIC models, especially in situations where the assumption of equal latent variance assumption is not likely to hold. © 2024 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['Bayesian', 'Moderated', 'Nonlinear', 'Factor', 'Analysis', 'Approach', 'DIF', 'Detection', 'violation', 'Equal', 'Variance', 'Assumption']","['bayesian', 'moderated', 'nonlinear', 'factor', 'analysis', 'approach', 'dif', 'detection', 'violation', 'equal', 'variance', 'assumption']",bayesian moderated nonlinear factor analysis approach dif detection violation equal variance assumption
Jin K.-Y.; Eckes T.,Measuring the Impact of Peer Interaction in Group Oral Assessments with an Extended Many-Facet Rasch Model,2024,61.0,"Many language proficiency tests include group oral assessments involving peer interaction. In such an assessment, examinees discuss a common topic with others. Human raters score each examinee's spoken performance on specially designed criteria. However, measurement models for analyzing group assessment data usually assume local person independence and thus fail to consider the impact of peer interaction on the assessment outcomes. This research advances an extended many-facet Rasch model for group assessments (MFRM-GA), accounting for local person dependence. In a series of simulations, we examined the MFRM-GA's parameter recovery and the consequences of ignoring peer interactions under the traditional modeling approach. We also used a real dataset from the English-speaking test of the Language Proficiency Assessment for Teachers (LPAT) routinely administered in Hong Kong to illustrate the efficiency of the new model. The discussion focuses on the model's usefulness for measuring oral language proficiency, practical implications, and future research perspectives. © 2023 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['measure', 'Impact', 'Peer', 'Interaction', 'Group', 'oral', 'assessment', 'Extended', 'ManyFacet', 'Rasch']","['measure', 'impact', 'peer', 'interaction', 'group', 'oral', 'assessment', 'extended', 'manyfacet', 'rasch']",measure impact peer interaction group oral assessment extended manyfacet rasch

Chen Y.; Zhang J.; Yang Y.; Lee Y.-S.,Latent Space Model for Process Data,2022,59.0,"The development of human-computer interactive items in educational assessments provides opportunities to extract useful process information for problem-solving. However, the complex, intensive, and noisy nature of process data makes it challenging to model with the traditional psychometric methods. Social network methods have been applied to visualize and analyze process data. Nonetheless, research about statistical modeling of process information using social network methods is still limited. This article explored the application of the latent space model (LSM) for analyzing process data in educational assessment. The adjacent matrix of transitions between actions was created based on the weighted and directed network of action sequences and related auxiliary information. Then, the adjacent matrix was modeled with LSM to identify the lower-dimensional latent positions of actions. Three applications based on the results from LSM were introduced: action clustering, error analysis, and performance measurement. The simulation study showed that LSM can cluster actions from the same problem-solving strategy and measure students’ performance by comparing their action sequences with the optimal strategy.

Li L.; Becker B.J.,Assessing Differential Bundle Functioning Using Meta-Analysis,2021,58.0,"Differential bundle functioning (DBF) has been proposed to quantify the accumulated amount of differential item functioning (DIF) in an item cluster/bundle (Douglas, Roussos, and Stout). The simultaneous item bias test (SIBTEST, Shealy and Stout) has been used to test for DBF (e.g., Walker, Zhang, and Surber). Research on DBF may have the potential to reveal the mechanism underlying DIF. However, an unresolved issue is the lack of an effect size for DBF, making it difficult to assess and compare the amounts of DBF within and between tests. We propose using meta-analysis techniques to study DBF. By meta-analyzing DIF indices, we can examine the heterogeneity of DIF across items, using the weighted average of DIF indices in an item bundle as a measure of effect size for DBF. A Monte Carlo simulation study compared the performance of our proposed effect size for DBF and a new test of nonzero average DIF in an item bundle with that of a DBF test using SIBTEST. When the primary and secondary dimensions were moderately correlated, our proposed effect size for DBF had little bias; the test of nonzero average DIF also showed power and Type I error levels comparable to those of the DBF test. © 2021 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['assess', 'Differential', 'Bundle', 'Functioning', 'MetaAnalysis']","['assess', 'differential', 'bundle', 'functioning', 'metaanalysis']",assess differential bundle functioning metaanalysis

In order to fit such models, the ratings data must be sufficiently connected in order to estimate rater effects. Due to popular rating designs used in large-scale testing scenarios, there tends to be a large proportion of missing data, yielding sparse matrices and estimation issues. In this article, we explore the impact of different types of connectedness, or linkage, brought about by using a linkage set—a collection of responses scored by most or all raters. We also explore the impact of the properties and composition of the linkage set, the different connectedness yielded from different rating designs, and the role of scores from automated scoring engines. In designing monitoring systems using the rater response version of the generalized partial credit model, the study results suggest use of a linkage set, especially a large one that is comprised of responses representing the full score scale. Results also show that a double-human-scoring design provides more connectedness than a design with one human and an automated scoring engine. Furthermore, scores from automated scoring engines do not provide adequate connectedness.

Bolt D.M.; Liao X.,On the Positive Correlation between DIF and Difficulty: A New Theory on the Correlation as Methodological Artifact,2021,58.0,"We revisit the empirically observed positive correlation between DIF and difficulty studied by Freedle and commonly seen in tests of verbal proficiency when comparing populations of different mean latent proficiency levels. It is shown that a positive correlation between DIF and difficulty estimates is actually an expected result (absent any true DIF) in the presence of systematically negative ICC asymmetry. Under such conditions, conditional upon sum score, correct responses to easier items are indicative of higher latent proficiency than correct responses to more difficult items. Negative ICC asymmetry, which can occur as a result of disjunctively interacting latent subprocesses (including disjunctive combinations of proficiency-based guessing and problem-solving processes, for example), is suggested to be widely present among items used in many verbal tests due to their general lack of problem-solving complexity and the anticipated presence of proficiency-related guessing. When systematic, negative ICC asymmetries result in a shrinkage of units at the lower end of the IRT metric when traditional symmetric IRT models are applied. We demonstrate by simulation an ensuing DIF-difficulty correlation artifact in application of a model-based DIF approach, as well as for the Mantel-Haenszel and Standardization DIF detection methods. A sensitivity analysis illustration demonstrates how assuming a fixed level of negative asymmetry in the ICCs effectively makes an observed positive correlation between DIF and difficulty seen when fitting symmetric ICCs go away. © 2021 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['Positive', 'Correlation', 'DIF', 'Difficulty', 'New', 'Theory', 'Correlation', 'Methodological', 'Artifact']","['positive', 'correlation', 'dif', 'difficulty', 'new', 'theory', 'correlation', 'methodological', 'artifact']",positive correlation dif difficulty new theory correlation methodological artifact
Guo W.; Wind S.A.,Examining the Impacts of Ignoring Rater Effects in Mixed-Format Tests,2021,58.0,"The use of mixed-format tests made up of multiple-choice (MC) items and constructed response (CR) items is popular in large-scale testing programs, including the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and many district- and state-level assessments in the United States. Rater effects, or raters’ scoring tendencies that result in performances receiving different scores than are warranted given their quality, are concerns for the interpretation of scores on CR items. However, there are few published studies in which researchers have systematically considered the impact of ignoring rater effects when they are present on estimates of student ability using large-scale mixed-format assessments. Using results from an analysis of NAEP data, we systematically explored the impacts of rater effects on student achievement estimates. Our results suggest that in conditions that reflect many large-scale mixed-format assessments, directly modeling rater effects yields more accurate student achievement estimates than estimation procedures that do not incorporate raters.

Estimates of (Formula presented.), also called IRT scores or (Formula presented.), can be computed using estimators based on the likelihood function, such as maximum likelihood (ML), weighted likelihood (WL), maximum a posteriori (MAP), and expected a posteriori (EAP). Although the parameter space of (Formula presented.) is theoretically unrestricted, the range of finite (Formula presented.) is constrained by the estimator and test form properties, which is important to consider but often overlooked when developing a score scale for reporting purposes. Irrespective of the estimator or test forms at hand, a common practice is to fix arbitrary points symmetric about zero (e.g., −4 and 4) as anchors for deriving a score transformation, possibly resulting in unintended gaps or truncations at the extremes.

Frey A.; König C.; Fink A.,A Highly Adaptive Testing Design for PISA,2023,,"The highly adaptive testing (HAT) design is introduced as an alternative test design for the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). The principle of HAT is to be as adaptive as possible when selecting items while accounting for PISA's nonstatistical constraints and addressing issues concerning PISA such as item position effects. HAT combines established methods from the field of computerized adaptive testing. It is implemented in R and code is provided. HAT was compared to the PISA 2018 multistage design (MST) in a simulation study based on a factorial design with the independent variables response probability (RP;.50,.62), item pool optimality (PISA 2018, optimal), and ability level (low, medium, high). PISA-specific conditions regarding sample size, missing responses, and nonstatistical constraints were implemented. HAT clearly outperformed MST regarding test information, RMSE, and constraint management across ability groups but it showed slightly weaker item exposure. Raising RP to.62 did not decrease test information much and is therefore a viable option to foster students’ test-taking experience with HAT. Test information for HAT was up to three times higher than for MST when using a hypothetical optimal item pool.

These uses assume tests provide comparable measures of outcomes across student subgroups, but prior research suggests score comparisons across gender groups may be complicated by the type of test items used. This paper presents evidence that among nationally representative samples of 15-year-olds in the United States participating in the 2009, 2012, and 2015 PISA math and reading tests, there are consistent item format by gender differences. On average, male students answer multiple-choice items correctly relatively more often and female students answer constructed-response items correctly relatively more often. These patterns were consistent across 34 additional participating PISA jurisdictions, although the size of the format differences varied and were larger on average in reading than math. The average magnitude of the format differences is not large enough to be flagged in routine differential item functioning analyses intended to detect test bias but is large enough to raise questions about the validity of inferences based on comparisons of scores across gender groups.

Accurately detecting BRR behavior can improve test validities. Yu and Cheng (2019) showed that the change point analysis (CPA) procedure based on weighted residual (CPA-WR) performed well in detecting BRR. Compared with the CPA procedure, the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) obtains more detailed information. This study equipped the weighted residual statistic with EWMA, and proposed the EWMA-WR method to detect BRR. To make the critical values adaptive to the ability levels, this study proposed the Monte Carlo simulation with ability stratification (MC-stratification) method for calculating critical values. Compared to the original Monte Carlo simulation (MC) method, the newly proposed MC-stratification method generated a larger number of satisfactory results. The performances of CPA-WR and EWMA-WR were evaluated under different conditions that varied in the test lengths, abnormal proportions, critical values and smoothing constants used in the EWMA-WR method.

Combs A.,A New Bayesian Person-Fit Analysis Method Using Pivotal Discrepancy Measures,2023,60.0,"A common method of checking person-fit in Bayesian item response theory (IRT) is the posterior-predictive (PP) method.

Most vertical scaling methodologies rely heavily on the assumption that the construct being measured is unidimensional. In many testing situations, however, such an assumption could be problematic. For instance, the construct measured at one grade level may differ from that measured in another grade (e.g., construct shift). On the other hand, dimensions that involve low-level skills are usually mastered by almost all students as they progress to higher grades. These types of changes in the multidimensional structure, within and across grades, create challenges for developing a vertical scale. In this article, we propose the use of projective IRT (PIRT) as a potential solution to the problem. Assuming that a test measures a primary dimension of substantive interest as well as some peripheral dimensions, the idea underlying PIRT is to integrate out the secondary dimensions such that the model provides both item parameters and ability estimates for the primary dimension.

Lee Y.-H.; Haberman S.J.,Studying Score Stability with a Harmonic Regression Family: A Comparison of Three Approaches to Adjustment of Examinee-Specific Demographic Data,2021,58.0,"For assessments that use different forms in different administrations, equating methods are applied to ensure comparability of scores over time. Ideally, a score scale is well maintained throughout the life of a testing program. In reality, instability of a score scale can result from a variety of causes, some are expected while others may be unforeseen. The situation is more challenging for assessments that assemble many different forms and deliver frequent administrations per year. Harmonic regression, a seasonal-adjustment method, has been found useful in achieving the goal of differentiating between possible known sources of variability and unknown sources so as to study score stability for such assessments. As an extension, this paper presents a family of three approaches that incorporate examinees' demographic data into harmonic regression in different ways. A generic evaluation method based on jackknifing is developed to compare the approaches within the family. The three approaches are compared using real data from an international language assessment. Results suggest that all approaches perform similarly and are effective in meeting the goal. The paper also discusses the properties and limitations of the three approaches, along with inferences about score (in)stability based on the harmonic regression results. © 2020 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['study', 'Score', 'Stability', 'harmonic', 'regression', 'Family', 'Comparison', 'Three', 'Approaches', 'Adjustment', 'ExamineeSpecific', 'Demographic', 'Data']","['study', 'score', 'stability', 'harmonic', 'regression', 'family', 'comparison', 'three', 'approaches', 'adjustment', 'examineespecific', 'demographic', 'data']",study score stability harmonic regression family comparison three approaches adjustment examineespecific demographic data
Shermis M.D.,Anchoring Validity Evidence for Automated Essay Scoring,2022,59.0,"One of the challenges of discussing validity arguments for machine scoring of essays centers on the absence of a commonly held definition and theory of good writing. At best, the algorithms attempt to measure select attributes of writing and calibrate them against human ratings with the goal of accurate prediction of scores for new essays. Sometimes these attributes are based on the fundamentals of writing (e.g., fluency), but quite often they are based on locally developed rubrics that may be confounded with specific content coverage expectations. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to provide systematic evidence that machine scoring is assessing writing, but slices or correlates of writing performance. © 2022 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['anchor', 'Validity', 'Evidence', 'Automated', 'Essay', 'Scoring']","['anchor', 'validity', 'evidence', 'automated', 'essay', 'scoring']",anchor validity evidence automated essay scoring
Köhler C.; Khorramdel L.; Pokropek A.; Hartig J.,DIF Detection for Multiple Groups: Comparing Three-Level GLMMs and Multiple-Group IRT Models,2024,61.0,"For assessment scales applied to different groups (e.g., students from different states; patients in different countries), multigroup differential item functioning (MG-DIF) needs to be evaluated in order to ensure that respondents with the same trait level but from different groups have equal response probabilities on a particular item. The current study compares two approaches for DIF detection: a multiple-group item response theory (MG-IRT) model and a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). In the MG-IRT model approach, item parameters are constrained to be equal across groups and DIF is evaluated for each item in each group. In the GLMM, groups are treated as random, and item difficulties are modeled as correlated random effects with a joint multivariate normal distribution. Its nested structure allows the estimation of item difficulty variances and covariances at the group level. We use an excerpt from the PISA 2015 reading domain as an exemplary empirical investigation, and conduct a simulation study to compare the performance of the two approaches. Results from the empirical investigation show that the detection of countries with DIF is similar in both approaches. Results from the simulation study confirm this finding and indicate slight advantages of the MG-IRT model approach. © 2024 The Authors.

Kaufmann E.; Budescu D.V.,Do Teachers Consider Advice? On the Acceptance of Computerized Expert Models,2020,57.0,"The literature suggests that simple expert (mathematical) models can improve the quality of decisions, but people are not always eager to accept and endorse such models. We ran three online experiments to test the receptiveness to advice from computerized expert models. Middle- and high-school teachers (N = 435) evaluated student profiles that varied in several personal and task relevant factors. They were offered (Studies I and II), or could ask for (Study III), advice from either expert models or human advisors. Overall, teachers requested and followed advice of expert models less frequently than advice from humans. Task-relevant factors (task difficulty) seem to be more salient than personal factors for teachers’ willingness to receive advice. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['teacher', 'consider', 'Advice', 'Acceptance', 'Computerized', 'Expert', 'Models']","['teacher', 'consider', 'advice', 'acceptance', 'computerized', 'expert', 'models']",teacher consider advice acceptance computerized expert models
Wang C.; Chen P.; Jiang S.,Item Calibration Methods With Multiple Subscale Multistage Testing,2020,57.0,"Many large-scale educational surveys have moved from linear form design to multistage testing (MST) design. One advantage of MST is that it can provide more accurate latent trait (θ) estimates using fewer items than required by linear tests. However, MST generates incomplete response data by design; hence, questions remain as to how to calibrate items using the incomplete data from MST design. Further complication arises when there are multiple correlated subscales per test, and when items from different subscales need to be calibrated according to their respective score reporting metric. The current calibration-per-subscale method produced biased item parameters, and there is no available method for resolving the challenge. Deriving from the missing data principle, we showed when calibrating all items together the Rubin's ignorability assumption is satisfied such that the traditional single-group calibration is sufficient. When calibrating items per subscale, we proposed a simple modification to the current calibration-per-subscale method that helps reinstate the missing-at-random assumption and therefore corrects for the estimation bias that is otherwise existent. Three mainstream calibration methods are discussed in the context of MST, they are the marginal maximum likelihood estimation, the expectation maximization method, and the fixed parameter calibration. An extensive simulation study is conducted and a real data example from NAEP is analyzed to provide convincing empirical evidence. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['Item', 'Calibration', 'Methods', 'Multiple', 'Subscale', 'Multistage', 'Testing']","['item', 'calibration', 'methods', 'multiple', 'subscale', 'multistage', 'testing']",item calibration methods multiple subscale multistage testing
Fujimoto K.A.,A More Flexible Bayesian Multilevel Bifactor Item Response Theory Model,2020,57.0,"Multilevel bifactor item response theory (IRT) models are commonly used to account for features of the data that are related to the sampling and measurement processes used to gather those data. These models conventionally make assumptions about the portions of the data structure that represent these features. Unfortunately, when data violate these models' assumptions but these models are used anyway, incorrect conclusions about the cluster effects could be made and potentially relevant dimensions could go undetected. To address the limitations of these conventional models, a more flexible multilevel bifactor IRT model that does not make these assumptions is presented, and this model is based on the generalized partial credit model. Details of a simulation study demonstrating this model outperforming competing models and showing the consequences of using conventional multilevel bifactor IRT models to analyze data that violate these models' assumptions are reported. Additionally, the model's usefulness is illustrated through the analysis of the Program for International Student Assessment data related to interest in science. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['flexible', 'Bayesian', 'Multilevel', 'Bifactor', 'Item', 'Response', 'Theory']","['flexible', 'bayesian', 'multilevel', 'bifactor', 'item', 'response', 'theory']",flexible bayesian multilevel bifactor item response theory
Kim H.J.; Brennan R.L.; Lee W.-C.,A New Statistic to Assess Fitness of Cubic-Spline Postsmoothing,2020,57.0,"In equating, smoothing techniques are frequently used to diminish sampling error. There are typically two types of smoothing: presmoothing and postsmoothing. For polynomial log-linear presmoothing, an optimum smoothing degree can be determined statistically based on the Akaike information criterion or Chi-square difference criterion. For cubic-spline postsmoothing, visual inspection has been an important tool in choosing such optimum degrees in operational settings. This study introduces a new statistic for assessing the fitness of the cubic-spline postsmoothing method, which accommodates three conditions: (1) one standard error band, (2) deviation from unsmoothed equivalents, and (3) smoothness. A principal advantage of the new statistic proposed in this study is that an optimum degree of smoothing can be selected automatically by giving consistent amount of attention to deviation and smoothness across multiple equatings, whereas visual inspection may not be consistent. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['New', 'Statistic', 'Assess', 'Fitness', 'CubicSpline', 'postsmoothe']","['new', 'statistic', 'assess', 'fitness', 'cubicspline', 'postsmoothe']",new statistic assess fitness cubicspline postsmoothe
Kim Y.,Partial Identification of Answer Reviewing Effects in Multiple-Choice Exams,2020,57.0,"Does reviewing previous answers during multiple-choice exams help examinees increase their final score? This article formalizes the question using a rigorous causal framework, the potential outcomes framework. Viewing examinees’ reviewing status as a treatment and their final score as an outcome, the article first explains the challenges of identifying the causal effect of answer reviewing in regular exam-taking settings. In addition to the incapability of randomizing the treatment selection (reviewing status) and the lack of other information to make this selection process ignorable, the treatment variable itself is not fully known to researchers. Looking at examinees’ answer sheet data, it is unclear whether an examinee who did not change his or her answer on a specific item reviewed it but retained the initial answer (treatment condition) or chose not to review it (control condition). Despite such challenges, however, the article develops partial identification strategies and shows that the sign of the answer reviewing effect can be reasonably inferred. By analyzing a statewide math assessment data set, the article finds that reviewing initial answers is generally beneficial for examinees. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['Partial', 'Identification', 'Answer', 'Reviewing', 'Effects', 'MultipleChoice', 'Exams']","['partial', 'identification', 'answer', 'reviewing', 'effects', 'multiplechoice', 'exams']",partial identification answer reviewing effects multiplechoice exams
Thissen D.,Comments on Shelby Haberman's NCME Career Award Address: Statistical Theory and Assessment Practice,2020,57.0,"When I was a graduate student,1 Howard Wainer quoted his own graduate mentor, Harold Gulliksen, saying ""The difference between basic and applied research is that basic research has so many more applications.""2 Shelby Haberman illustrates that truth in his career award address, in which he summarizes some of the applied contributions he made to educational measurement during his years at ETS, based on his basic statistical research that continued from earlier decades. The breadth of application of Haberman's statistical research is illustrated by the range of examples in his address: the ""effects of model error in the analysis of item responses by use of latent-structure models, weighting to attempt to correct for sampling bias, and the effects of excessively complex models"" (p. 374). Those three topics do not include his seminal work on subscores (e.g., Haberman, 2008) or much of his work on item fit in IRT models (e.g., Haberman, Sinharay, and Chon, 2013); both of those lines of research were recognized with the NCME Annual Award for Exceptional Achieve-
ment in Educational Measurement in 2009 and 2015. Haberman includes pithy lines in his address that should be memorized by all students of educational measurement. Examples are: (referring to likelihood ratio tests between models) ""This kind of test typically suffices to demonstrate that any given IRT model is not valid"" (p. 375) followed a bit later by ""At this point, looking at the size of the error in a model appears more helpful than looking at the existence of error"" (p. 376). And the greatest piece of wisdom in the entire address: ""One challenge is that software produces numbers whether or not the numbers are meaningful"" (p. 381). Students told those things in classes on educational measurement might subsequently make better use of assessment data.

Lee S.,Logistic Regression Procedure Using Penalized Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Differential Item Functioning,2020,57.0,"In the logistic regression (LR) procedure for differential item functioning (DIF), the parameters of LR have often been estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. However, ML estimation suffers from the finite-sample bias. Furthermore, ML estimation for LR can be substantially biased in the presence of rare event data. The bias of ML estimation due to small samples and rare event data can degrade the performance of the LR procedure, especially when testing the DIF of difficult items in small samples. Penalized ML (PML) estimation was originally developed to reduce the finite-sample bias of conventional ML estimation and also was known to reduce the bias in the estimation of LR for the rare events data. The goal of this study is to compare the performances of the LR procedures based on the ML and PML estimation in terms of the statistical power and Type I error. In a simulation study, Swaminathan and Rogers's Wald test based on PML estimation (PSR) showed the highest statistical power in most of the simulation conditions, and LRT based on conventional PML estimation (PLRT) showed the most robust and stable Type I error.

Castellano K.E.; McCaffrey D.F.,Comparing the Accuracy of Student Growth Measures,2020,57.0,"Testing programs are often interested in using a student growth measure. This article presents analytic derivations of the accuracy of common student growth measures on both the raw scale of the test and the percentile rank scale in terms of the proportional reduction in mean squared error and the squared correlation between the estimator and target. The study contrasts the accuracy of the growth measures against that of current status measures—current test scores and their percentile ranks. Key findings include the extent that status measures are more accurate than any of the growth measures and that alternative methods to estimate growth could be more accurate than the currently used methods. Our findings highlight the importance for evaluating the statistical properties of growth measures along with other concerns for states that are debating the reporting of growth. Our results also point out that assessing the accuracy of growth measures requires the specification of quantities of interest in terms of latent achievement rather than observed test scores, which is common practice for developing status measures but essentially never done by testing programs for growth measures. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['compare', 'Accuracy', 'Student', 'Growth', 'Measures']","['compare', 'accuracy', 'student', 'growth', 'measures']",compare accuracy student growth measures
Guo H.; Dorans N.J.,Using Weighted Sum Scores to Close the Gap Between DIF Practice and Theory,2020,57.0,"We make a distinction between the operational practice of using an observed score to assess differential item functioning (DIF) and the concept of departure from measurement invariance (DMI) that conditions on a latent variable. DMI and DIF indices of effect sizes, based on the Mantel-Haenszel test of common odds ratio, converge under restricted conditions if a simple sum score is used as the matching or conditioning variable in a DIF analysis. Based on theoretical results, we demonstrate analytically that matching on a weighted sum score can significantly reduce the difference between DIF and DMI measures over what can be achieved with a simple sum score. We also examine the utility of binning methods that could facilitate potential operational use of DIF with weighted sum scores.

Hong S.E.; Monroe S.; Falk C.F.,Performance of Person-Fit Statistics Under Model Misspecification,2020,57.0,"In educational and psychological measurement, a person-fit statistic (PFS) is designed to identify aberrant response patterns. For parametric PFSs, valid inference depends on several assumptions, one of which is that the item response theory (IRT) model is correctly specified. Previous studies have used empirical data sets to explore the effects of model misspecification on PFSs. We further this line of research by using a simulation study, which allows us to explore issues that may be of interest to practitioners. Results show that, depending on the generating and analysis item models, Type I error rates at fixed values of the latent variable may be greatly inflated, even when the aggregate rates are relatively accurate. Results also show that misspecification is most likely to affect PFSs for examinees with extreme latent variable scores.

Chen C.-W.; Wang W.-C.; Chiu M.M.; Ro S.,Item Selection and Exposure Control Methods for Computerized Adaptive Testing with Multidimensional Ranking Items,2020,57.0,"The use of computerized adaptive testing algorithms for ranking items (e.g., college preferences, career choices) involves two major challenges: unacceptably high computation times (selecting from a large item pool with many dimensions) and biased results (enhanced preferences or intensified examinee responses because of repeated statements across items). To address these issues, we introduce subpool partition strategies for item selection and within-person statement exposure control procedures. Simulations showed that the multinomial method reduces computation time while maintaining measurement precision. Both the freeze and revised Sympson-Hetter online (RSHO) methods controlled the statement exposure rate; RSHO sacrificed some measurement precision but increased pool use.

Castellano K.E.; McCaffrey D.F.,Estimating the Accuracy of Relative Growth Measures Using Empirical Data,2020,57.0,"The residual gain score has been of historical interest, and its percentile rank has been of interest more recently given its close correspondence to the popular Student Growth Percentile. However, these estimators suffer from low accuracy and systematic bias (bias conditional on prior latent achievement). This article explores three alternatives—using the expected a posterior (EAP), conditioning on an additional lagged score, and correcting for measurement error bias from the prior score (Corrected-Observed)—evaluated in terms of their systematic bias, squared correlation with their target (R2), and proportional reduction in mean squared error (PRMSE). Both analytic results (under model assumptions) and empirical results (found using item response data to calculate the growth estimators) reveal that the EAP estimators are the most accurate, whereas the Corrected-Observed removes systematic bias, but reduces overall accuracy. Adding another prior year often decreases accuracy but only slightly reduces systematic bias at realistic test reliabilities. For all estimators, R2 and PRMSE are substantially below levels that are considered necessary for reporting educational measurements with moderate to high stakes. For all but the EAP, the raw residual gain estimators have negative PRMSE, indicating that inferences about a student's latent growth would be more accurate if students were assigned the average residual rather than estimating their residual. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['estimate', 'Accuracy', 'Relative', 'Growth', 'measure', 'empirical', 'Data']","['estimate', 'accuracy', 'relative', 'growth', 'measure', 'empirical', 'data']",estimate accuracy relative growth measure empirical data

The main objective of this study is to propose a new statistic and to compare its performance to the performance of the Akaike information criterion and likelihood ratio chi-square difference statistics in selecting the smoothing parameter for polynomial loglinear equating under the random groups design. These model selection statistics were compared for four sample sizes (500, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000) and eight simulated equating conditions, including both conditions where equating is not needed and conditions where equating is needed.

van der Linden W.J.; Choi S.W.,Improving Item-Exposure Control in Adaptive Testing,2020,57.0,"One of the methods of controlling test security in adaptive testing is imposing random item-ineligibility constraints on the selection of the items with probabilities automatically updated to maintain a predetermined upper bound on the exposure rates. Three major improvements of the method are presented. First, a few modifications to improve the initialization of the method and accelerate the impact of its feedback mechanism on the observed item-exposure rates are introduced. Second, the case of conditional item-exposure control given the uncertainty of examinee's ability parameter is addressed. Third, although rare for a well-designed item pool, when applied in combination with the shadow-test approach to adaptive testing the method may meet occasional infeasibility of the shadow-test model.

The direct approach would be to combine anchoring methods developed for two-group scenarios with multigroup DIF-detection methods. Alternatively, multiple tests could be carried out. The results of these tests need to be aggregated to determine the anchor for the final DIF analysis. In this study, the direct approach and three aggregation rules are investigated. All approaches are combined with a variety of anchoring methods, such as the “all-other purified” and “mean p-value threshold” methods, in two simulation studies based on the Rasch model. Our results indicate that the direct approach generally does not lead to more accurate or even to inferior results than the aggregation rules. The min rule overall shows the best trade-off between low false alarm rate and medium to high hit rate. However, it might be too sensitive when the number of groups is large. In this case, the all rule may be a good compromise. We also take a closer look at the anchor selection method “next candidate,” which performed rather poorly, and suggest possible improvements. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['Comparison', 'Aggregation', 'Rules', 'Selecting', 'Anchor', 'Items', 'Multigroup', 'DIF', 'Analysis']","['comparison', 'aggregation', 'rules', 'selecting', 'anchor', 'items', 'multigroup', 'dif', 'analysis']",comparison aggregation rules selecting anchor items multigroup dif analysis

The pseudo-equivalent group approach allows to achieve pseudo-equivalence using propensity score reweighting techniques.

The article presents Monte-Carlo simulations and a real data application based on data from the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Monte-Carlo simulations suggest that the pseudo-equivalent group design is particularly useful whenever there is a large overlap across the two groups with respect to balancing variables and when the correlation between such variables and ability is medium or high.

Clauser B.E.; Kane M.; Clauser J.C.,Examining the Precision of Cut Scores Within a Generalizability Theory Framework: A Closer Look at the Item Effect,2020,57.0,"An Angoff standard setting study generally yields judgments on a number of items by a number of judges (who may or may not be nested in panels). Variability associated with judges (and possibly panels) contributes error to the resulting cut score. The variability associated with items plays a more complicated role. To the extent that the mean item judgments directly reflect empirical item difficulties, the variability in Angoff judgments over items would not add error to the cut score, but to the extent that the mean item judgments do not correspond to the empirical item difficulties, variability in mean judgments over items would add error to the cut score. In this article, we present two generalizability-theory–based analyses of the proportion of the item variance that contributes to error in the cut score. For one approach, variance components are estimated on the probability (or proportion-correct) scale of the Angoff judgments, and for the other, the judgments are transferred to the theta scale of an item response theory model before estimating the variance components. The two analyses yield somewhat different results but both indicate that it is not appropriate to simply ignore the item variance component in estimating the error variance. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['examine', 'Precision', 'Cut', 'Scores', 'Generalizability', 'Theory', 'Framework', 'close', 'look', 'Item', 'Effect']","['examine', 'precision', 'cut', 'scores', 'generalizability', 'theory', 'framework', 'close', 'look', 'item', 'effect']",examine precision cut scores generalizability theory framework close look item effect

Two popular robust methods are biweight and Huber weight. So far, research on these methods has been quite limited. This article proposes the maximum a posteriori biweight (BMAP) and Huber weight (HMAP) estimation methods. These methods use the Bayesian prior distribution to compensate for information lost due to aberrant responses. They may also be more resistant to the detrimental effects of downweighting the nonaberrant responses. The effectiveness of BMAP and HMAP was evaluated through a Monte Carlo simulation. Results show that both methods, especially BMAP, are more effective than the original biweight and Huber weight in correcting mild forms of aberrant behavior. © 2019 by the National Council on Measurement in Education","['Bayesian', 'Extension', 'Biweight', 'Huber', 'Weight', 'robust', 'Ability', 'estimation']","['bayesian', 'extension', 'biweight', 'huber', 'weight', 'robust', 'ability', 'estimation']",bayesian extension biweight huber weight robust ability estimation
