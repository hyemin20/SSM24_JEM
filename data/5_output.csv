Güler N.; Penfield R.D.,A comparison of the logistic regression and contingency table methods for simultaneous detection of uniform and nonuniform dif,2009,46,"In this study, we investigate the logistic regression (LR), Mantel-Haenszel (MH), and Breslow-Day (BD) procedures for the simultaneous detection of both uniform and nonuniform differential item functioning (DIF). A simulation study was used to assess and compare the Type I error rate and power of a combined decision rule (CDR), which assesses DIF using a combination of the decisions made with BD and MH to those of LR. The results revealed that while the Type I error rate of CDR was consistently below the nominal alpha level, the Type I error rate of LR was high for the conditions having unequal ability distributions. In addition, the power of CDR was consistently higher than that of LR across all forms of DIF. © 2009 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['comparison', 'logistic', 'regression', 'contingency', 'table', 'method', 'simultaneous', 'detection', 'uniform', 'nonuniform', 'dif']","['comparison', 'logistic', 'regression', 'contingency', 'table', 'method', 'simultaneous', 'detection', 'uniform', 'nonuniform', 'dif']",comparison logistic regression contingency table method simultaneous detection uniform nonuniform dif
Kim S.,A comparative study of IRT fixed parameter calibration methods,2006,43,"This article provides technical descriptions of five fixed parameter calibration (FPC) methods, which were based on marginal maximum likelihood estimation via the EM algorithm, and evaluates them through simulation. The five FPC methods described are distinguished from each other by how many times they update the prior ability distribution and by how many EM cycles they use. Specifically, the five FPC methods included no prior weights updating and one EM cycle (NWU-OEM) or multiple EM cycles (NWU-MEM), one prior weights updating and one EM cycle (OWU-OEM) or multiple EM cycles (OWU-MEM), and multiple weights updating and multiple EM cycles (MWU-MEM) methods. All the five FPC methods were evaluated in terms of recovery of the underlying ability distribution and item parameters. An important factor in the simulation was three different ability (normal) distributions - N(0, 1), N(0.5, 1.2 2), and N(1, 1.4 2)-for FPC groups, with the fixed item parameters obtained with a reference N(0, 1) group. Only the MWU-MEM method appeared to perform properly under all the three distributions. Under the N(0, 1) distribution, the NWU-MEM and OWU-MEM methods also appeared to perform properly. Under the N(0.5, 1.2 2), and N(1, 1.4 2) distributions, however, the four methods other than the MWU-MEM method resulted in some or severe under-estimation in the recovery.","['comparative', 'study', 'IRT', 'fix', 'parameter', 'calibration', 'method']","['comparative', 'study', 'irt', 'fix', 'parameter', 'calibration', 'method']",comparative study irt fix parameter calibration method
Dorans N.J.,Using subpopulation invariance to assess test score equity,2004,41,"Score equity assessment (SEA) is introduced, and placed within a fair assessment context that includes differential prediction or fair selection and differential item functioning. The notion of subpopulation invariance of linking functions is central to the assessment of score equity, just as it has been for differential item functioning and differential prediction. Advanced Placement (AP) data are used for illustrative purposes. The use of multiple-choice and constructed response items in AP provides an opportunity to observe a case where subpopulation invariance of linking functions does not hold (U.S. History), and a case in which it does hold (Calculus AB). The lack of invariance for U.S. History might be attributed to several sources. The role of SEA in assessing the fairness of test assembly processes is discussed.","['subpopulation', 'invariance', 'assess', 'test', 'score', 'equity']","['subpopulation', 'invariance', 'assess', 'test', 'score', 'equity']",subpopulation invariance assess test score equity
Finch H.,Comparison of the performance of varimax and promax rotations: Factor structure recovery for dichotomous items,2006,43,"Nonlinear factor analysis is a tool commonly used by measurement specialists to identify both the presence and nature of multidimensionality in a set of test items, an important issue given that standard Item Response Theory models assume a unidimensional latent structure. Results from most factor-analytic algorithms include loading matrices, which are used to link items with factors. Interpretation of the loadings typically occurs after they have been rotated in order to amplify the presence of simple structure. The purpose of this simulation study is to compare the ability of two commonly used methods of rotation, Varimax and Promax, in terms of their ability to correctly link items to factors and to identify the presence of simple structure. Results suggest that the two approaches are equally able to recover the underlying factor structure, regardless of the correlations among the factors, though the oblique method is better able to identify the presence of a ""simple structure."" These results suggest that for identifying which items are associated with which factors, either approach is effective, but that for identifying simple structure when it is present, the oblique method is preferable. © Copyright 2006 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['comparison', 'performance', 'varimax', 'promax', 'rotation', 'Factor', 'structure', 'recovery', 'dichotomous', 'item']","['comparison', 'performance', 'varimax', 'promax', 'rotation', 'factor', 'structure', 'recovery', 'dichotomous', 'item']",comparison performance varimax promax rotation factor structure recovery dichotomous item
Meyer J.P.; Setzer J.C.,A comparison of bridging methods in the analysis of NAEP trends with the new race subgroup definitions,2009,46,"Recent changes to federal guidelines for the collection of data on race and ethnicity allow respondents to select multiple race categories. Redefining race subgroups in this manner poses problems for research spanning both sets of definitions. NAEP long-term trends have used the single-race subgroup definitions for over thirty years. Little is known about the effects of redefining race subgroups on these trends. Bridging methods for reconciling the single and multiple race definitions have been developed. These methods treat single-race subgroup membership as unknown or missing. A simulation study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of four bridging methods: multiple imputation logistic regression, multiple imputation probabilistic whole assignment, deterministic whole assignment - smallest group, and deterministic whole assignment - largest group. Only the first of these methods incorporates covariate information about examinees into the bridging procedure. The other three methods only use information contained in the race item response. The simulation took into account the percentage of biracial examinees and the missing data mechanism. Results indicated that the multiple imputation logistic regression was often the best performing method. Given that all K-12 and higher education institutions will be required to use the multiple-race definitions by 2009, implications for No Child Left Behind and other federally mandated reporting are discussed. © 2009 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['comparison', 'bridge', 'method', 'analysis', 'naep', 'trend', 'new', 'race', 'subgroup', 'definition']","['comparison', 'bridge', 'method', 'analysis', 'naep', 'trend', 'new', 'race', 'subgroup', 'definition']",comparison bridge method analysis naep trend new race subgroup definition
Gierl M.J.; Leighton J.P.; Tan X.,Evaluating DETECT classification accuracy and consistency when data display complex structure,2006,43,"DETECT, the acronym for Dimensionality Evaluation To Enumerate Contributing Traits, is an innovative and relatively new nonparametric dimensionality assessment procedure used to identify mutually exclusive, dimensionally homogeneous clusters of items using a genetic algorithm (Zhang & Stout, 1999). Because the clusters of items are mutually exclusive, this procedure is most useful when the data display approximate simple structure. In many testing situations, however, data display a complex multidimensional structure. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate DETECT item classification accuracy and consistency when the data display different degrees of complex structure using both simulated and real data. Three variables were manipulated in the simulation study: The percentage of items displaying complex structure (10%, 30%, and 50%), the correlation between dimensions (.00, .30, .60, .75, and .90), and the sample size (500, 1,000, and 1,500). The results from the simulation study reveal that DETECT can accurately and consistently cluster items according to their true underlying dimension when as many as 30% of the items display complex structure, if the correlation between dimensions is less than or equal to .75 and the sample size is at least 1,000 examinees. If 50% of the items display complex structure, then the correlation between dimensions should be less than or equal to .60 and the sample size be, at least, 1,000 examinees. When the correlation between dimensions is .90, DETECT does not work well with any complex dimensional structure or sample size. Implications for practice and directions for future research are discussed.","['evaluate', 'detect', 'classification', 'accuracy', 'consistency', 'datum', 'display', 'complex', 'structure']","['evaluate', 'detect', 'classification', 'accuracy', 'consistency', 'datum', 'display', 'complex', 'structure']",evaluate detect classification accuracy consistency datum display complex structure
Prowker A.; Camilli G.,Looking beyond the overall scores of NAEP assessments: Applications of generalized linear mixed modeling for exploring value-added item difficulty effects,2007,44,"The central idea of differential item functioning (DIF) is to examine differences between two groups at the item level while controlling for overall proficiency. This approach is useful for examining hypotheses at a finer-grain level than are permitted by a total test score. The methodology proposed in this paper is also aimed at estimating differences at the item rather than the overall score level, yet with the innovation where item-level differences for many groups simultaneously are the focus. This is a straightforward generalization of DIF as variance rather than one or several group differences; conceptually, this can be referred to as item difficulty variation (IDV). When instruction is of interest, and ""groups"" is a unit at which instruction is determined or delivered, then IDV signals value-added effects that can be influenced by either demographic or instructional variables. © 2007 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['look', 'overall', 'score', 'naep', 'assessment', 'application', 'generalized', 'linear', 'mixed', 'modeling', 'explore', 'valueadde', 'item', 'difficulty', 'effect']","['look', 'overall', 'score', 'naep', 'assessment', 'application', 'generalized', 'linear', 'mixed', 'modeling', 'explore', 'valueadde', 'item', 'difficulty', 'effect']",look overall score naep assessment application generalized linear mixed modeling explore valueadde item difficulty effect
Monahan P.O.; Lee W.-C.; Ankenmann R.D.,Generating dichotomous item scores with the four-parameter beta compound binomial model,2007,44,"A Monte Carlo simulation technique for generating dichotomous item scores is presented that implements (a) a psychometric model with different explicit assumptions than traditional parametric item response theory (IRT) models, and (b) item characteristic curves without restrictive assumptions concerning mathematical form. The four-parameter beta compound-binomial (4PBCB) strong true score model (with two-term approximation to the compound binomial) is used to estimate and generate the true score distribution. The nonparametric item-true score step functions are estimated by classical item difficulties conditional on proportion-correct total score. The technique performed very well in replicating inter-item correlations, item statistics (point-biserial correlation coefficients and item proportion-correct difficulties), first four moments of total score distribution, and coefficient alpha of three real data sets consisting of educational achievement test scores. The technique replicated real data (including subsamples of differing proficiency) as well as the three-parameter logistic (3PL) IRT model (and much better than the 1PL model) and is therefore a promising alternative simulation technique. This 4PBCB technique may be particularly useful as a more neutral simulation procedure for comparing methods that use different IRT models. © 2007 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['generate', 'dichotomous', 'item', 'score', 'fourparameter', 'beta', 'compound', 'binomial']","['generate', 'dichotomous', 'item', 'score', 'fourparameter', 'beta', 'compound', 'binomial']",generate dichotomous item score fourparameter beta compound binomial

We find that the variation in estimated effects resulting from the different mathematics achievement measures is large relative to variation resulting from choices about model specification, and that the variation within teachers across achievement measures is larger than the variation across teachers.

Van Der Linden W.J.,A comparison of item-selection methods for adaptive tests with content constraints,2005,42,"In test assembly, a fundamental difference exists between algorithms that select a test sequentially or simultaneously. Sequential assembly allows us to optimize an objective function at the examinee's ability estimate, such as the test information function in computerized adaptive testing. But it leads to the non-trivial problem of how to realize a set of content constraints on the test - a problem more naturally solved by a simultaneous item-selection method. Three main item-selection methods in adaptive testing offer solutions to this dilemma. The spiraling method moves item selection across categories of items in the pool proportionally to the numbers needed from them. Item selection by the weighted-deviations method (WDM) and the shadow test approach (STA) is based on projections of the future consequences of selecting an item. These two methods differ in that the former calculates a projection of a weighted sum of the attributes of the eventual test and the latter a projection of the test itself. The pros and cons of these methods are analyzed. An empirical comparison between the WDM and STA was conducted for an adaptive version of the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), which showed equally good item-exposure rates but violations of some of the constraints and larger bias and inaccuracy of the ability estimator for the WDM.","['comparison', 'itemselection', 'method', 'adaptive', 'test', 'content', 'constraint']","['comparison', 'itemselection', 'method', 'adaptive', 'test', 'content', 'constraint']",comparison itemselection method adaptive test content constraint
Henson R.; Templin J.; Douglas J.,Using efficient model based sum-scores for conducting skills diagnoses,2007,44,"Consider test data, a specified set of dichotomous skills measured by the test, and an IRT cognitive diagnosis model (ICDM). Statistical estimation of the data set using the ICDM can provide examinee estimates of mastery for these skills, referred to generally as attributes. With such detailed information about each examinee, future instruction can be tailored specifically for each student, often referred to as formative assessment. However, use of such cognitive diagnosis models to estimate skills in classrooms can require computationally intensive and complicated statistical estimation algorithms, which can diminish the breadth of applications of attribute level diagnosis. We explore the use of sum-scores (each attribute measured by a sum-score) combined with estimated model-based sum-score mastery/nonmastery cutoffs as an easy-to-use and intuitive method to estimate attribute mastery in classrooms and other settings where simple skills diagnostic approaches are desirable. Using a simulation study of skills diagnosis test settings and assuming a test consisting of a model-based calibrated set of items, correct classification rates (CCRs) are compared among four model-based approaches for estimating attribute mastery, namely using full model-based estimation and three different methods of computing sum-scores (simple sum-scores, complex sum-scores, and weighted complex sum-scores) combined with model-based mastery sum-score cutoffs. In summary, the results suggest that model-based sum-scores and mastery cutoffs can be used to estimate examinee attribute mastery with only moderate reductions in CCRs in comparison with the full model-based estimation approach. Certain topics are mentioned that are currently being investigated, especially applications in classroom and textbook settings. © 2007 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['efficient', 'base', 'sumscore', 'conduct', 'skill', 'diagnosis']","['efficient', 'base', 'sumscore', 'conduct', 'skill', 'diagnosis']",efficient base sumscore conduct skill diagnosis
Gorin J.S.,Manipulating processing difficulty of reading comprehension questions: The feasibility of verbal item generation,2005,42,"Based on a previously validated cognitive processing model of reading comprehension, this study experimentally examines potential generative components of text-based multiple-choice reading comprehension test questions. Previous research (Embretson & Wetzel, 1987; Gorin & Embretson, 2005; Sheehan & Ginther, 2001) shows text encoding and decision processes account for significant proportions of variance in item difficulties. In the current study, Linear Logistic Latent Trait Model (LLTM; Fischer, 1973) parameter estimates of experimentally manipulated items are examined to further verify the impact of encoding and decision processes on item difficulty. Results show that manipulation of some passage features, such as increased use of negative wording, significantly increases item difficulty in some cases, whereas others, such as altering the order of information presentation in a passage, did not significantly affect item difficulty, but did affect reaction time. These results suggest that reliable changes in difficulty and response time through algorithmic manipulation of certain task features is feasible. However, non-significant results for several manipulations highlight potential challenges to item generation in establishing direct links between theoretically relevant item features and individual item processing. Further examination of these relationships will be informative to item writers as well as test developers interested in the feasibility of item generation as an assessment tool.","['manipulate', 'processing', 'difficulty', 'read', 'comprehension', 'question', 'feasibility', 'verbal', 'item', 'generation']","['manipulate', 'processing', 'difficulty', 'read', 'comprehension', 'question', 'feasibility', 'verbal', 'item', 'generation']",manipulate processing difficulty read comprehension question feasibility verbal item generation
Lamprianou I.; Boyle B.,Accuracy of measurement in the context of mathematics National Curriculum tests in England for ethnic minority pupils and pupils who speak English as an additional language,2004,41,"Research has suggested that inappropriate or misfitting response patterns may have detrimental effects on the quality and validity of measurement. It has been suggested that factors like language and ethnic background are related to the generation of misfitting response patterns, but the empirical research on this is rather poor. This research analyzes data from three testing cycles of the National Curriculum tests in mathematics in England using the Rasch model. It was found that pupils having English as an additional language and pupils belonging to ethnic minorities are significantly more likely to generate aberrant response patterns. However, within the groups of pupils belonging to ethnic minorities, those who speak English as an additional language are not significantly more likely to generate misfitting response patterns. This may indicate that the ethnic background effect is more significant than the effect of the first language spoken. The results suggest that pupils having English as an additional language and pupils belonging to ethnic minorities are mismeasured significantly more than the remainder of pupils by taking the mathematics National Curriculum tests.

Yao L.; Boughton K.,Multidimensional linking for tests with mixed item types,2009,46,"Numerous assessments contain a mixture of multiple choice (MC) and constructed response (CR) item types and many have been found to measure more than one trait. Thus, there is a need for multidimensional dichotomous and polytomous item response theory (IRT) modeling solutions, including multidimensional linking software. For example, multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) may have a promising future in subscale score proficiency estimation, leading toward a more diagnostic orientation, which requires the linking of these subscale scores across different forms and populations. Several multidimensional linking studies can be found in the literature; however, none have used a combination of MC and CR item types. Thus, this research explores multidimensional linking accuracy for tests composed of both MC and CR items using a matching test characteristic/response function approach. The two-dimensional simulation study presented here used real data-derived parameters from a large-scale statewide assessment with two subscale scores for diagnostic profiling purposes, under varying conditions of anchor set lengths (6, 8, 16, 32, 60), across 10 population distributions, with a mixture of simple versus complex structured items, using a sample size of 3,000. It was found that for a well chosen anchor set, the parameters recovered well after equating across all populations, even for anchor sets composed of as few as six items. © 2009 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['multidimensional', 'link', 'test', 'mixed', 'item', 'type']","['multidimensional', 'link', 'test', 'mixed', 'item', 'type']",multidimensional link test mixed item type

Betebenner D.W.; Shang Y.; Xiang Y.; Zhao Y.; Yue X.,The impact of performance level misclassification on the accuracy and precision of percent at performance level measures,2008,45,"No Child Left Behind (NCLB) performance mandates, embedded within state accountability systems, focus school AYP (adequate yearly progress) compliance squarely on the percentage of students at or above proficient. The singular importance of this quantity for decision-making purposes has initiated extensive research into percent proficient as a measure of school quality. In particular, technical discussions have scrutinized the impact of sampling, measurement, and other sources of error on percent proficient statistics. In this article, we challenge the received orthodoxy that measurement error associated with individual students' scores is inconsequential for aggregate percent proficient statistics. Synthesizing current classification accuracy research with techniques from randomized response designs, we establish results which specify the extent to which measurement error - manifest as performance level misclassifications - produces bias and increases error variability for percent at performance level statistics.

Muckle T.J.; Karabatsos G.,Hierarchical generalized linear models for the analysis of judge ratings,2009,46,"It is known that the Rasch model is a special two-level hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM). This article demonstrates that the many-faceted Rasch model (MFRM) is also a special case of the two-level HGLM, with a random intercept representing examinee ability on a test, and fixed effects for the test items, judges, and possibly other facets. This perspective suggests useful modeling extensions of the MFRM. For example, in the HGLM framework it is possible to model random effects for items and judges in order to assess their stability across examinees. The MFRM can also be extended so that item difficulty and judge severity are modeled as functions of examinee characteristics (covariates), for the purposes of detecting differential item functioning and differential rater functioning.

Li Y.H.; Lissitz R.W.,Applications of the analytically derived asymptotic standard errors of item response theory item parameter estimates,2004,41,"The analytically derived asymptotic standard errors (SEs) of maximum likelihood (ML) item estimates can be approximated by a mathematical function without examinees' responses to test items, and the empirically determined SEs of marginal maximum likelihood estimation (MMLE)/Bayesian item estimates can be obtained when the same set of items is repeatedly estimated from the simulation (or resampling) test data. The latter method will result in rather stable and accurate SE estimates as the number of replications increases, but requires cumbersome and time-consuming calculations. Instead of using the empirically determined method, the adequacy of using the analytical-based method in predicting the SEs for item parameter estimates was examined by comparing results produced from both approaches. The results indicated that the SEs yielded from both approaches were, in most cases, very similar, especially when they were applied to a generalized partial credit model. This finding encourages test practitioners and researchers to apply the analytically asymptotic SEs of item estimates to the context of item-linking studies, as well as to the method of quantifying the SEs of equating scores for the item response theory (IRT) true-score method.

The elements to be used in the four functions were associated with (a) a random number assigned to each item, (b) the absolute difference between an examinee's current ability estimate and an item difficulty, (c) the absolute difference between an examinee's current ability estimate and an optimum item difficulty, and (d) item information. The results indicated that this combined CAT fully utilized all the items in the pool, reduced the maximum exposure rates, and achieved more homogeneous exposure rates. Moreover, its precision in recovering ability estimates was similar to that of the maximum item-information method. The combined CAT method resulted in the best overall results compared with the other individual CAT item-selection methods. The findings from the combined CAT are encouraging. Future uses are discussed.","['increase', 'homogeneity', 'cats', 'itemexposure', 'rate', 'minimize', 'maximize', 'varied', 'target', 'function', 'assemble', 'shadow', 'test']","['increase', 'homogeneity', 'cats', 'itemexposure', 'rate', 'minimize', 'maximize', 'varied', 'target', 'function', 'assemble', 'shadow', 'test']",increase homogeneity cats itemexposure rate minimize maximize varied target function assemble shadow test

Jang E.E.; Roussos L.,An investigation into the dimensionality of TOEFL using conditional covariance-based nonparametric approach,2007,44,This article reports two studies to illustrate methodologies for conducting a conditional covariance-based nonparametric dimensionality assessment using data from two forms of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Study 1 illustrates how to assess overall dimensionality of the TOEFL including all three subtests. Study 2 is aimed at illustrating how to conduct dimensionality analyses for a testlet-based test by focusing on the Reading Comprehension (RC) section in combination with item content analyses and hypothesis testing. The results of Study 1 indicated that both TOEFL forms involve two dominant dimensions corresponding to the Listening Comprehension section and the combination of the Reading Comprehension section and Structure and Written Expression section. The extensive RC analyses from Study 2 revealed strong evidence that a significant amount of the RC multidimensionality came from testlet effects.

Korobko O.B.; Glas C.A.W.; Bosker R.J.; Luyten J.W.,Comparing the difficulty of examination subjects with item response theory,2008,45,"Methods are presented for comparing grades obtained in a situation where students can choose between different subjects. It must be expected that the comparison between the grades is complicated by the interaction between the students' pattern and level of proficiency on one hand, and the choice of the subjects on the other hand. Three methods based on item response theory (IRT) for the estimation of proficiency measures that are comparable over students and subjects are discussed: a method based on a model with a unidimensional representation of proficiency, a method based on a model with a multidimensional representation of proficiency, and a method based on a multidimensional representation of proficiency where the stochastic nature of the choice of examination subjects is explicitly modeled. The methods are compared using the data from the Central Examinations in Secondary Education in the Netherlands. The results show that the unidimensional IRT model produces unrealistic results, which do not appear when using the two multidimensional IRT models.

Four IRT linking methods including the mean/mean, mean/sigma, Haebara, and Stocking-Lord methods have been presented for use with single-format tests. This study extends the four linking methods to a mixture of unidimensional IRT models for mixed-format tests. Each linking method extended is intended to handle mixed-format tests using any mixture of the following five IRT models: the three-parameter logistic, graded response, generalized partial credit, nominal response (NR), and multiple-choice (MC) models. A simulation study is conducted to investigate the performance of the four linking methods extended to mixed-format tests. Overall, the Haebara and Stocking-Lord methods yield more accurate linking results than the mean/mean and mean/sigma methods.

We proposed a linking method called the synthetic function, which is a weighted average of the identity function and a traditional equating function (in this case, the chained linear equating function). Specifically, we compared the synthetic, identity, and chained linear functions for various-sized samples from two types of national assessments. One design used a highly reliable test and an external anchor, and the other used a relatively low-reliability test and an internal anchor. The results from each of these methods were compared to the criterion equating function derived from the total samples with respect to linking bias and error.

Finkelman M.; Nering M.L.; Roussos L.A.,A conditional exposure control method for multidimensional adaptive testing,2009,46,"In computerized adaptive testing (CAT), ensuring the security of test items is a crucial practical consideration. A common approach to reducing item theft is to define maximum item exposure rates, i.e., to limit the proportion of examinees to whom a given item can be administered. Numerous methods for controlling exposure rates have been proposed for tests employing the unidimensional 3-PL model. The present article explores the issues associated with controlling exposure rates when a multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) model is utilized and exposure rates must be controlled conditional upon ability. This situation is complicated by the exponentially increasing number of possible ability values in multiple dimensions. The article introduces a new procedure, called the generalized Stocking-Lewis method, that controls the exposure rate for students of comparable ability as well as with respect to the overall population. A realistic simulation set compares the new method with three other approaches: Kullback-Leibler information with no exposure control, Kullback-Leibler information with unconditional Sympson-Hetter exposure control, and random item selection. © 2009 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['conditional', 'exposure', 'control', 'method', 'multidimensional', 'adaptive', 'testing']","['conditional', 'exposure', 'control', 'method', 'multidimensional', 'adaptive', 'testing']",conditional exposure control method multidimensional adaptive testing

Penfield R.D.,Assessing differential step functioning in polytomous items using a common odds ratio estimator,2007,44,"Many statistics used in the assessment of differential item functioning (DIF) in polytomous items yield a single item-level index of measurement invariance that collapses information across all response options of the polytomous item. Utilizing a single item-level index of DIF can, however, be misleading if the magnitude or direction of the DIF changes across the steps underlying the polytomous response process. A more comprehensive approach to examining measurement invariance in polytomous item formats is to examine invariance at the level of each step of the polytomous item, a framework described in this article as differential step functioning (DSF). This article proposes a nonparametric DSF estimator that is based on the Mantel-Haenszel common odds ratio estimator (Mantel & Haenszel, 1959), which is frequently implemented in the detection of DIF in dichotomous items. A simulation study demonstrated that when the level of DSF varied in magnitude or sign across the steps underlying the polytomous response options, the DSF-based approach typically provided a more powerful and accurate test of measurement invariance than did corresponding item-level DIF estimators. © 2007 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['assess', 'differential', 'step', 'function', 'polytomous', 'item', 'common', 'odd', 'ratio', 'estimator']","['assess', 'differential', 'step', 'function', 'polytomous', 'item', 'common', 'odd', 'ratio', 'estimator']",assess differential step function polytomous item common odd ratio estimator

Dimensionality assessment is carried out using two goodness-of-fit statistics that are compared to reference x 2 distributions. A Monte Carlo study is used with item parameters based on a statewide basic skills assessment and the SAT. Other factors that are varied include the correlation among the latent traits, the number of items, the number of subjects, skewness of the latent traits, and the presence or absence of guessing. The performance of the two procedures is judged by the accuracy in determining the number of underlying dimensions, and the degree to which items are correctly clustered together. Results indicate that the new, NOHARM-based method appears to perform comparably to DETECT in terms of simultaneously finding the correct number of dimensions and clustering items correctly. NOHARM is generally better able to determine the number of underlying dimensions, but less able to group items together, than DETECT.

Holland P.W.; Sinharay S.; Von Davier A.A.; Han N.,An approach to evaluating the missing data assumptions of the chain and post-stratification equating methods for the NEAT design,2008,45,"Two important types of observed score equating (OSE) methods for the non-equivalent groups with Anchor Test (NEAT) design are chain equating (CE) and post-stratification equating (PSE).

Both types of methods include linear and nonlinear equating functions. In practical situations, it is known that the PSE and CE methods will give different results when the two groups of examinees differ on the anchor test. However, given that both types of methods are justified as OSE methods by making different assumptions about the missing data in the NEAT design, it is difficult to conclude which, if either, of the two is more correct in a particular situation. This study compares the predictions of the PSE and CE assumptions for the missing data using a special data set for which the usually missing data are available.

Bridgeman B.; Cline F.,Effects of differentially time-consuming tests on computer-adaptive test scores,2004,41,"Time limits on some computer-adaptive tests (CATs) are such that many examinees have difficulty finishing, and some examinees may be administered tests with more time-consuming items than others. Results from over 100,000 examinees suggested that about half of the examinees must guess on the final six questions of the analytical section of the Graduate Record Examination if they were to finish before time expires. At the higher-ability levels, even more guessing was required because the questions administered to higher-ability examinees were typically more time consuming. Because the scoring model is not designed to cope with extended strings of guesses, substantial errors in ability estimates can be introduced when CATs have strict time limits. Furthermore, examinees who are administered tests with a disproportionate number of time-consuming items appear to get lower scores than examinees of comparable ability who are administered tests containing items that can be answered more quickly, though the issue is very complex because of the relationship of time and difficulty, and the multidimensionality of the test.","['effect', 'differentially', 'timeconsuming', 'test', 'computeradaptive', 'test', 'score']","['effect', 'differentially', 'timeconsuming', 'test', 'computeradaptive', 'test', 'score']",effect differentially timeconsuming test computeradaptive test score

These forms were equated using mean equating, linear equating, unsmoothed equipercentile equating, and equipercentile equating using two through six moments of log-linear presmoothing with samples of 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200. The results indicated that identity equating was preferable to any equating method when samples were as small as 25. For samples of 50 and above, the choice of an equating method over identity equating depended on the location of the passing score relative to examinee performance. If passing scores were located below the mean, where data were sparser, mean equating produced the smallest percentage of misclassified examinees. For passing scores near the mean, all methods produced similar results with linear equating being the most accurate. For passing scores above the mean, equipercentile equating with 2-and 3-moment presmoothing were the best equating methods. Higher levels of presmoothing did not improve the results.","['accuracy', 'random', 'group', 'equate', 'small', 'sample']","['accuracy', 'random', 'group', 'equate', 'small', 'sample']",accuracy random group equate small sample
Schulz E.M.; Betebenner D.; Ahn M.,Hierarchical logistic regression in course placement,2004,41,"Whether hierarchical logistic regression can reduce the sample size requirement for estimating optimal cutoff scores in a course placement service where predictive validity is measured by a threshold utility function is explored. Data from courses with varying class size were randomly partitioned into two halves per course. Non-hierarchical and hierarchical analyses were performed on each half. Compared to their nonhierarchical counterparts, hierarchically estimated cutoff scores from different halves were more stable and predicted course outcomes in the other half more accurately. These differences were mostpronounced with small samples. Sample size requirements for developing cutoff scores for course placement can be substantially reduced if hierarchical logistic regression is used.","['hierarchical', 'logistic', 'regression', 'course', 'placement']","['hierarchical', 'logistic', 'regression', 'course', 'placement']",hierarchical logistic regression course placement
Puhan G.; Moses T.P.; Grant M.C.; McHale F.,Small-sample equating using a single-group nearly equivalent test (SiGNET) design,2009,46,"A single-group (SG) equating with nearly equivalent test forms (SiGNET) design was developed by Grant to equate small-volume tests. Under this design, the scored items for the operational form are divided into testlets or mini tests. An additional testlet is created but not scored for the first form. If the scored testlets are testlets 1-6 and the unscored testlet is testlet 7, then the first form is composed of testlets 1-6 and the second form is composed of testlets 2-7. The seven testlets are administered as a single administered form, and when a sufficient number of examinees have taken the administered form, the second form (testlets 2-7) is equated to the first form (testlets 1-6) using an SG equating design. As evident, this design facilitates the use of an SG equating and allows for the accumulation of data, both of which may reduce equating error.

Kupermintz H.,On the reliability of categorically scored examinations,2004,41,A decision-theoretic approach to the question of reliability in categorically scored examinations is explored. The concepts of true scores and errors are discussed as they deviate from conventional psychometric definitions and measurement error in categorical scores is cast in terms of misclassifications. A reliability measure based on proportional reduction in loss (PRL) is then presented and exemplified with data from a large-scale assessment. The link between the PRL approach and the classical conception of reliability is discussed. Some design considerations for reliability studies are also discussed.,"['reliability', 'categorically', 'score', 'examination']","['reliability', 'categorically', 'score', 'examination']",reliability categorically score examination
Bolt D.M.; Gierl M.J.,Testing features of graphical DIF: Application of a regression correction to three nonparametric statistical tests,2006,43,"Inspection of differential item functioning (DIF) in translated test items can be informed by graphical comparisons of item response functions (IRFs) across translated forms. Due to the many forms of DIF that can emerge in such analyses, it is important to develop statistical tests that can confirm various characteristics of DIF when present. Traditional nonparametric tests of DIF (Mantel-Haenszel, SIBTEST) are not designed to test for the presence of nonuniform or local DIF, while common probability difference (P-DIF) tests (e.g., SIBTEST) do not optimize power in testing for uniform DIF, and thus may be less useful in the context of graphical DIF analyses. In this article, modifications of three alternative nonparametric statistical tests for DIF, Fisher's χ 2 test, Cochran's Z test, and Goodman's U test (Marascuilo & Slaughter, 1981), are investigated for these purposes. A simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness of a regression correction procedure in improving the statistical performance of the tests when using an internal test score as the matching criterion. Simulation power and real data analyses demonstrate the unique information provided by these alternative methods compared to SIBTEST and Mantel-Haenszel in confirming various forms of DIF in translated tests.","['testing', 'feature', 'graphical', 'DIF', 'application', 'regression', 'correction', 'nonparametric', 'statistical', 'test']","['testing', 'feature', 'graphical', 'dif', 'application', 'regression', 'correction', 'nonparametric', 'statistical', 'test']",testing feature graphical dif application regression correction nonparametric statistical test

When these procedures are used together, they can provide complementary information about the extent to which item order effects impact test scores, in overall score distributions and also at specific test scores. In addition to detecting item order effects, the integrated procedures also suggest the equating function that most adequately adjusts the scores to mitigate the effects.

The item fit was estimated using two fit statistics: the likelihood ratio statistic (ξB2), and the standardized residuals (SRs). All the item parameters were simulated to be normally distributed. Results showed that the levels of item discrimination and guessing affected the item-fit values.

Wang W.-C.; Wilson M.; Shih C.-L.,Modeling randomness in judging rating scales with a random-effects rating scale model,2006,43,"This study presents the random-effects rating scale model (RE-RSM) which takes into account randomness in the thresholds over persons by treating them as random-effects and adding a random variable for each threshold in the rating scale model (RSM) (Andrich, 1978). The RE-RSM turns out to be a special case of the multidimensional random coefficients multinomial logit model (MRCMLM) (Adams, Wilson, & Wang, 1997) so that the estimation procedures for the MRCMLM can be directly applied. The results of the simulation indicated that when the data were generated from the RSM, using the RSM and the RE-RSM to fit the data made little difference: both resulting in accurate parameter recovery. When the data were generated from the RE-RSM, using the RE-RSM to fit the data resulted in unbiased estimates, whereas using the RSM resulted in biased estimates, large fit statistics for the thresholds, and inflated test reliability. An empirical example of 10 items with four-point rating scales was illustrated in which four models were compared: the RSM, the RE-RSM, the partial credit model (Masters, 1982), and the constrained random-effects partial credit model.

Sinharay S.; Holland P.W.,Is it necessary to make anchor tests mini-versions of the tests being equated or can some restrictions be relaxed?,2007,44,"It is a widely held belief that anchor tests should be miniature versions (i.e., minitests), with respect to content and statistical characteristics, of the tests being equated. This article examines the foundations for this belief regarding statistical characteristics. It examines the requirement of statistical representativeness of anchor tests that are content representative. The equating performance of several types of anchor tests, including those having statistical characteristics that differ from those of the tests being equated, is examined through several simulation studies and a real data example. Anchor tests with a spread of item difficulties less than that of a total test seem to perform as well as a minitest with respect to equating bias and equating standard error. Hence, the results demonstrate that requiring an anchor test to mimic the statistical characteristics of the total test may be too restrictive and need not be optimal.

Bolt D.,The present and future of IRT-based cognitive diagnostic models (ICDMs) and related methods,2007,44,"As the goals of educational assessment evolve from the strictly evaluative to the diagnostically useful, so also evolve the statistical methods used to build, validate, and interpret educational tests. The methods discussed in this special issue all approach diagnosis in an item response theory (IRT) related way, with models that are parameterized at the item level and that extract information from individual item responses. Clearly, their most distinguishing feature is their more complex, multidimensional representation of examinee proficiency. This representation can be built directly into an item response model (as seen in most clearly in Almond, DiBello, Moulder, & Zapata-Rivera, 2007; Henson, Templin, & Douglas, 2007; Roussos, Templin, & Henson, 2007; Stout, 2007) or else it can provide a framework for interpreting (residual) pattems in item responses (as is seen in Gierl, 2007). The complexity of the proficiency space introduces corresponding complexities into the statistical modeling and score reporting aspects of diagnosis. A high level of expert judgment is needed in formulating appropriate models. One of the primary challenges in implementing IRT-based cognitively diagnostic model (ICDMs) requires determining which aspects of the modeling process should be constrained through expert judgment and which can and should be informed by observed item response data. The vast array of psychometric models now available for diagnosis and the different ways they handle these complexities (e.g., how many levels for each skill, how do skills interact, how does skill mastery translate to item performance, etc.) make model selection a central issue. At the same time, it can be challenging to compare models according to goodness of fit due to the many other aspects within each model that must be informed by experts (e.g., entries of the item-by-skill Q-
matrix, structure of the proficiency space, etc). Data-driven model re-specification is often messy. Collectively, the papers presented in this Special Issue provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in IRT-based diagnosis. While all emphasize a common end-goal of examinee diagnosis, the process by which this is achieved and the balance of data-driven and expert-driven decision making used along the way also introduce important differences.","['present', 'future', 'irtbased', 'cognitive', 'diagnostic', 'icdm', 'relate', 'method']","['present', 'future', 'irtbased', 'cognitive', 'diagnostic', 'icdm', 'relate', 'method']",present future irtbased cognitive diagnostic icdm relate method
Cui Y.; Leighton J.P.,The hierarchy consistency index: Evaluating person fit for cognitive diagnostic assessment,2009,46,"In this article, we introduce a person-fit statistic called the hierarchy consistency index (HCI) to help detect misfitting item response vectors for tests developed and analyzed based on a cognitive model. The HCI ranges from -1.0 to 1.0, with values close to -1.0 indicating that students respond unexpectedly or differently from the responses expected under a given cognitive model. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the power of the HCI in detecting different types of misfitting item response vectors. Simulation results revealed that the detection rate of the HCI was a function of type of misfit, item discriminating power, and test length. The best detection rates were achieved when the HCI was applied to tests that consisted of a large number of highly discriminating items. In addition, whether a misfitting item response vector can be correctly identified depends, to a large degree, on the number of misfits of the item response vector relative to the cognitive model. When misfitting response behavior only affects a small number of item responses, the resulting item response vector will not be substantially different from the expectations under the cognitive model and consequently may not be statistically identified as misfitting. As an item response vector deviates further from the model expectations, misfits are more easily identified and consequently higher detection rates of the HCI are expected. © 2009 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['hierarchy', 'consistency', 'index', 'evaluate', 'person', 'fit', 'cognitive', 'diagnostic', 'assessment']","['hierarchy', 'consistency', 'index', 'evaluate', 'person', 'fit', 'cognitive', 'diagnostic', 'assessment']",hierarchy consistency index evaluate person fit cognitive diagnostic assessment

Culpepper S.A.; Davenport E.C.,Assessing differential prediction of college grades by race/ethnicity with a multilevel model,2009,46,"Previous research notes the importance of understanding racial/ethnic differential prediction of college grades across multiple institutions. Institutional variation in selection indices is especially important given some states' laws governing public institutions' admissions decisions. This paper employed multilevel moderated multiple regression to study the variation of selection indices across 30 institutions and the accuracy of selection indices in predicting college grades for students of different racial/ethnic backgrounds. Several benefits of multilevel models for cross-institutional differential prediction studies were described and include: controlling for institutional differences in range restriction, providing reliability estimates of least squares estimates, and adjusting criterion scores for differences in coursework difficulty. The findings from this study provide evidence of institutional variation in selection indices, which challenges current laws aimed at standardizing them. Specifically, there was evidence that the predictor slope coefficients varied across institutions, in addition to the estimates that measured intercept differences for African and Asian American students.

When test length was less than 10 items, FP and KP tended to outperform F at extreme trait levels in Condition 1. However, in more realistic settings, it could not be concluded that FP and KP outperformed F, especially when item exposure control was imposed.

Roussos L.A.; Ozbek O.Y.,Formulation of the DETECT population parameter and evaluation of DETECT estimator bias,2006,43,"The development of the DETECT procedure marked an important advancement in nonparametric dimensionality analysis. DETECT is the first nonparametric technique to estimate the number of dimensions in a data set, estimate an effect size for multidimensionality, and identify which dimension is predominantly measured by each item. The efficacy of DETECT critically depends on accurate, minimally biased estimation of the expected conditional covariances of all the item pairs. However, the amount of bias in the DETECT estimator has been studied only in a few simulated unidimensional data sets. This is because the value of the DETECT population parameter is known to be zero for this case and has been unknown for cases when multidimensionality is present. In this article, integral formulas for the DETECT population parameter are derived for the most commonly used parametric multidimensional item response theory model, the Reckase and McKinley model. These formulas are then used to evaluate the bias in DETECT by positing a multidimensional model, simulating data from the model using a very large sample size (to eliminate random error), calculating the large-sample DETECT statistic, and finally calculating the DETECT population parameter to compare with the large-sample statistic. A wide variety of two- and three-dimensional models, including both simple structure and approximate simple structure, were investigated. The results indicated that DETECT does exhibit statistical bias in the large-sample estimation of the item-pair conditional covariances; but, for the simulated tests that had 20 or more items, the bias was small enough to result in the large-sample DETECT almost always correctly partitioning the items and the DETECT effect size estimator exhibiting negligible bias.","['formulation', 'detect', 'population', 'parameter', 'evaluation', 'DETECT', 'estimator', 'bias']","['formulation', 'detect', 'population', 'parameter', 'evaluation', 'detect', 'estimator', 'bias']",formulation detect population parameter evaluation detect estimator bias

A method based on a conservative bound using the hypergeometric distribution, denoted p, was compared with a method where the probability for each score combination was calculated using a highest density region (HDR). Furthermore, these methods were compared with the standardized log-likelihood statistic with and without a correction for the estimated latent trait value (denoted as l z* and lz, respectively). Data were simulated on the basis of the one-parameter logistic model, and both parametric and nonparametric logistic regression was used to obtain estimates of the latent trait. Results showed that it is important to take the trait level into account when comparing subtest scores. In a nonparametric item response theory (IRT) context, on adapted version of the HDR method was a powerful alterative to ρ. In a parametric IRT context, results showed that lz* had the highest power when the data were simulated conditionally on the estimated latent trait level.","['pattern', 'sum', 'score', 'paperandpencil', 'test', 'computeradaptive', 'test', 'detect', 'misfitting', 'item', 'score', 'pattern']","['pattern', 'sum', 'score', 'paperandpencil', 'test', 'computeradaptive', 'test', 'detect', 'misfitting', 'item', 'score', 'pattern']",pattern sum score paperandpencil test computeradaptive test detect misfitting item score pattern

Teachers were able to reliably classify items into the domains by content. Using expected percentage correct scores on the domains, it was possible to describe each achievement level boundary (Basic, Proficient, and Advanced) on the NAEP scale by patterns of skill that include both mastery and non-mastery, and to show that higher achievement levels are associated with mastery of more skills. We conclude that general achievement tests like NAEP can be used to provide criterion-referenced descriptions of growth in achievement as a sequential mastery of skills.","['domainlevel', 'approach', 'describe', 'growth', 'achievement']","['domainlevel', 'approach', 'describe', 'growth', 'achievement']",domainlevel approach describe growth achievement

Van Der Linden W.J.,Conceptual issues in response-time modeling,2009,46,"Two different traditions of response-time (RT) modeling are reviewed: the tradition of distinct models for RTs and responses, and the tradition of model integration in which RTs are incorporated in response models or the other way around. Several conceptual issues underlying both traditions are made explicit and analyzed for their consequences. We then propose a hierarchical modeling framework consistent with the first tradition but with the integration of their parameter structures as a second level of modeling. Two examples of the framework are presented. Also, a fundamental equation is derived which relates the RTs on test items to the speed of the test taker and the time intensity of the items. The equation serves as the core of the RT model in the framework. Finally, empirical applications of the framework demonstrating its practical value are reviewed. © 2009 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","['conceptual', 'issue', 'responsetime', 'modeling']","['conceptual', 'issue', 'responsetime', 'modeling']",conceptual issue responsetime modeling
Huitzing H.A.,An interactive method to solve infeasibility in linear programming test assembling models,2004,41,"In optimal assembly of tests from item banks, linear programming (LP) models have proved to be very useful. Assembly by hand has become nearly impossible, but these LP techniques are able to find the best solutions, given the demands and needs of the test to be assembled and the specifics of the item bank from which it is assembled. However, sometimes even LP techniques do not offer an acceptable solution to the test assembler. Infeasibility occurs when the demands are contradictory. These contradictions may be rather complex, especially when stated in terms of LP models. Techniques are described that can solve these infeasibility problems in different manners. The objectives are twofold. First, the assembler is given a helping hand to identify the bottlenecks in the specifications of the LP model. Second, a solution is forced, such that the test assembler is always presented a test as close as possible to the original specifications. These objectives should be realizable both automatically and interactively with the test assembler.","['interactive', 'method', 'solve', 'infeasibility', 'linear', 'programming', 'test', 'assemble']","['interactive', 'method', 'solve', 'infeasibility', 'linear', 'programming', 'test', 'assemble']",interactive method solve infeasibility linear programming test assemble

In an item bank, the items are stored with their characteristics. A test is constructed by selecting a set of items that fulfills the specifications set by the test assembler.

A problem arises when it is impossible to construct a test from the item pool that meets all specifications, that is, when the model is not feasible. Several methods exist to handle these infeasibility problems. In this article, test assembly models resulting from two practical testing programs were reconstructed to be infeasible.

Lee W.-C.; Brennan R.L.; Kolen M.J.,Estimators of conditional scale-score standard errors of measurement: A simulation study,2000,37,"This paper describes four procedures previously developed for estimating conditional standard errors of measurement for scale scores: the IRT procedure (Kolen, Zeng, & Hanson, 1996), the binomial procedure (Brennan & Lee, 1999), the compound binomial procedure (Brennan & Lee, 1999), and the Feldt-Qualls procedure (1998). These four procedures are based on different underlying assumptions. The IRT procedure is based on the unidimensional IRT model assumptions. The binomial and compound binomial procedures employ, as the distribution of errors, the binomial model and compound binomial model, respectively. By contrast, the Feldt-Qualls procedure does not depend on a particular psychometric model, and it simply translates any estimated conditional raw-score SEM to a conditional scale-score SEM. These procedures are compared in a simulation study, which involves two-dimensional data sets. The presence of two category dimensions reflects a violation of the IRT unidimensionality assumption. The relative accuracy of these procedures for estimating conditional scale-score standard errors of measurement is evaluated under various circumstances. The effects of three different types of transformations of raw scores are investigated including developmental standard scores, grade equivalents, and percentile ranks. All the procedures discussed appear viable. A general recommendation is made that test users select a procedure based on various factors such as the type of scale score of concern, characteristics of the test, assumptions involved in the estimation procedure, and feasibility and practicability of the estimation procedure.","['estimator', 'conditional', 'scalescore', 'standard', 'error', 'simulation', 'study']","['estimator', 'conditional', 'scalescore', 'standard', 'error', 'simulation', 'study']",estimator conditional scalescore standard error simulation study

Attention is given to both traditional norm-referenced perspectives on reliability as well as criterion-referenced perspectives that focus on error-tolerance ratios and functions of them. The procedures discussed are illustrated using three cohorts of data for third- and fourth-grade students in Iowa who took the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills in recent years. For these data, estimates of reliability for norm-referenced decisions tend to be relatively low. By contrast, for criterion-referenced decisions, estimates of reliability-like coefficients based on error-tolerance ratios tend to be noticeably larger.","['methodology', 'examine', 'Reliability', 'Group', 'Mean', 'Difference', 'Scores']","['methodology', 'examine', 'reliability', 'group', 'mean', 'difference', 'scores']",methodology examine reliability group mean difference scores
Katz I.R.; Bennett R.E.; Berger A.E.,Effects of response format on difficulty of SAT-mathematics items: It's not the strategy,2000,37,"Problem-solving strategy is frequently cited as mediating the effects of response format (multiple-choice, constructed response) on item difficulty, yet there are few direct investigations of examinee solution procedures. Fifty-five high school students solved parallel constructed response and multiple-choice items that differed only in the presence of response options. Student performance was videotaped to assess solution strategies. Strategies were categorized as ""traditional"" - those associated with constructed response problem solving (e.g., writing and solving algebraic equations) - or ""nontraditional"" - those associated with multiple-choice problem solving (e.g., estimating a potential solution). Surprisingly, participants sometimes adopted nontraditional strategies to solve constructed response items. Furthermore, differences in difficulty between response formats did not correspond to differences in strategy choice: some items showed a format effect on strategy but no effect on difficulty; other items showed the reverse. We interpret these results in light of the relative comprehension challenges posed by the two groups of items.","['effect', 'response', 'format', 'difficulty', 'satmathematic', 'item', 'strategy']","['effect', 'response', 'format', 'difficulty', 'satmathematic', 'item', 'strategy']",effect response format difficulty satmathematic item strategy
Rodriguez M.C.,Construct equivalence of multiple-choice and constructed-response items: A random effects synthesis of correlations,2003,40,"A thorough search of the literature was conducted to locate empirical studies investigating the trait or construct equivalence of multiple-choice (MC) and conslructed-response (CR) items. Of the 67 studies identified, 29 studies included 56 correlations between items in both formats. These 56 correlations were corrected for attenuation and synthesized to establish evidence for a common estimate of correlation (true-score correlations). The 56 disattenuated correlations were highly heterogeneous. A search for moderators to explain this variation uncovered the role of the design characteristics of test items used in the studies. When items are constructed in both formats using the same stem (stem equivalent), the mean correlation between the two formats approaches unity and is significantly higher than when using non-stem-equivalent items (particularly when using essay-type items). Construct equivalence, in part, appears to be a function of the item design method or the item writer's intent.","['construct', 'equivalence', 'multiplechoice', 'constructedresponse', 'item', 'random', 'effect', 'synthesis', 'correlation']","['construct', 'equivalence', 'multiplechoice', 'constructedresponse', 'item', 'random', 'effect', 'synthesis', 'correlation']",construct equivalence multiplechoice constructedresponse item random effect synthesis correlation
Chen S.-Y.; Ankenmann R.D.; Spray J.A.,The relationship between item exposure and test overlap in computerized adaptive testing,2003,40,"The purpose of this article is to present an analytical derivation for the mathematical form of an average between-test overlap index as a function of the item exposure index, for fixed-length computerized adaptive tests (CATs). This algebraic relationship is used to investigate the simultaneous control of item exposure at both the item and test levels. The results indicate that, in fixed-length CATs, control of the average between-test overlap is achieved via the mean and variance of the item exposure rates of the items that constitute the CAT item pool. The mean of the item exposure rates is easily manipulated. Control over the variance of the item exposure rates can be achieved via the maximum item exposure rate (rmax. Therefore, item exposure control methods which implement a specification of rmax (e.g., Sympson & Hetter, 1985) provide the most direct control at both the item and test levels.","['relationship', 'item', 'exposure', 'test', 'overlap', 'computerized', 'adaptive', 'testing']","['relationship', 'item', 'exposure', 'test', 'overlap', 'computerized', 'adaptive', 'testing']",relationship item exposure test overlap computerized adaptive testing

The eigenvalues of the item correlation matrix and Yen's Q3 were not greatly influenced by multidimensionality under conditions where the responses of a large proportion of students shared the influence of common instruction across subtopics.

Chang S.-W.; Ansley T.N.,A comparative study of item exposure control methods in computerized adaptive testing,2003,40,"This study compared the properties of five methods of item exposure control within the purview of estimating examinees' abilities in a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) context. Each exposure control algorithm was incorporated into the item selection procedure and the adaptive testing progressed based on the CAT design established for this study. The merits and shortcomings of these strategies were considered under different item pool sizes and different desired maximum exposure rates and were evaluated in light of the observed maximum exposure rates, the test overlap rates, and the conditional standard errors of measurement. Each method had its advantages and disadvantages, but no one possessed all of the desired characteristics. There was a clear and logical trade-off between item exposure control and measurement precision. The Stocking and Lewis conditional multinomial procedure and, to a slightly lesser extent, the Davey and Parshall method seemed to be the most promising considering all of the factors that this study addressed.","['comparative', 'study', 'item', 'exposure', 'control', 'method', 'computerized', 'adaptive', 'testing']","['comparative', 'study', 'item', 'exposure', 'control', 'method', 'computerized', 'adaptive', 'testing']",comparative study item exposure control method computerized adaptive testing
Bolt D.M.; Cohen A.S.; Wollack J.A.,Item parameter estimation under conditions of test speededness: Application of a mixture Rasch model with ordinal constraints,2002,39,"When tests are administered under fixed time constraints, test performances can be affected by speededness. Among other consequences, speededness can result in inaccurate parameter estimates in item response theory (IRT) models, especially for items located near the end of tests (Oshima, 1994). This article presents an IRT strategy for reducing contamination in item difficulty estimates due to speededness. Ordinal constraints are applied to a mixture Rasch model (Rost, 1990) so as to distinguish two latent classes of examinees: (a) a ""speeded"" class, comprised of examinees that had insufficient time to adequately answer end-of-test items, and (b) a ""nonspeeded"" class, comprised of examinees that had sufficient time to answer all items. The parameter estimates obtained for end-of-test items in the nonspeeded class are shown to more accurately approximate their difficulties when the items are administered at earlier locations on a different form of the test. A mixture model can also be used to estimate the class memberships of individual examinees. In this way, it can be determined whether membership in the speeded class is associated with other student characteristics. Results are reported for gender and ethnicity.","['item', 'parameter', 'estimation', 'condition', 'test', 'speededness', 'application', 'mixture', 'Rasch', 'ordinal', 'constraint']","['item', 'parameter', 'estimation', 'condition', 'test', 'speededness', 'application', 'mixture', 'rasch', 'ordinal', 'constraint']",item parameter estimation condition test speededness application mixture rasch ordinal constraint

However, previous research has shown that many contemporary tests contain item dependencies and not accounting for these dependencies leads to misleading estimates of item, test, and ability parameters. The goals of the study were (a) to review methods for detecting local item dependence (LID), (b) to discuss the use of testlets to account for LID in context-dependent item sets, (c) to apply LID detection methods and testlet-based item calibrations to data from a large-scale, high-stakes admissions test, and (d) to evaluate the results with respect to test score reliability and examinee proficiency estimation. Item dependencies were found in the test and these were due to test speededness or context dependence (related to passage structure). Also, the results highlight that steps taken to correct for the presence of LID and obtain less biased reliability estimates may impact on the estimation of examinee proficiency.

Walker C.M.; Beretvas S.N.,An empirical investigation demonstrating the multidimensional DIF paradigm: A cognitive explanation for DIF,2001,38,"Differential Item Functioning (DIF) is traditionally used to identify different item performance patterns between intact groups, most commonly involving race or sex comparisons. This study advocates expanding the utility of DIF as a step in construct validation. Rather than grouping examinees based on cultural differences, the reference and focal groups are chosen from two extremes along a distinct cognitive dimension that is hypothesized to supplement the dominant latent trait being measured. Specifically, this study investigates DIF between proficient and non-proficient fourth- and seventh-grade writers on open-ended mathematics test items that require students to communicate about mathematics. It is suggested that the occurrence of DIF in this situation actually enhances, rather than detracts from, the construct validity of the test because, according to the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), mathematical communication is an important component of mathematical ability, the dominant construct being assessed. However, the presence of DIF influences the validity of inferences that can be made from test scores and suggests that two scores should be reported, one for general mathematical ability and one for mathematical communication. The fact that currently only one test score is reported, a simple composite of scores on multiple-choice and open-ended items, may lead to incorrect decisions being made about examinees.","['empirical', 'investigation', 'demonstrate', 'multidimensional', 'DIF', 'paradigm', 'cognitive', 'explanation', 'DIF']","['empirical', 'investigation', 'demonstrate', 'multidimensional', 'dif', 'paradigm', 'cognitive', 'explanation', 'dif']",empirical investigation demonstrate multidimensional dif paradigm cognitive explanation dif

Bielinski J.; Davison M.L.,A sex difference by item difficulty interaction in multiple-choice mathematics items administered to national probability samples,2001,38,"A 1998 study by Bielinski and Davison reported a sex difference by item difficulty interaction in which easy items tended to be easier for females than males, and hard items tended to be harder for females than males. To extend their research to nationally representative samples of students, this study used math achievement data from the 1992 NAEP, the TIMSS, and the NELS: 88. The data included students in grades 4, 8, 10, and 12. The interaction was assessed by correlating the item difficulty difference (bmale - bfemale) with item difficulty computed on the combined male/female sample. Using only the multiple-choice mathematics items, the predicted negative correlation was found for all eight populations and was significant in five. An argument is made that this phenomenon may help explain the greater variability in math achievement among males as compared to females and the emergence of higher performance of males in late adolescence.","['sex', 'difference', 'item', 'difficulty', 'interaction', 'multiplechoice', 'mathematic', 'item', 'administer', 'national', 'probability', 'sample']","['sex', 'difference', 'item', 'difficulty', 'interaction', 'multiplechoice', 'mathematic', 'item', 'administer', 'national', 'probability', 'sample']",sex difference item difficulty interaction multiplechoice mathematic item administer national probability sample

Almost all methods of test assembly produced either moderation of impact in the appropriate direction or no change in impact.

Willingham W.W.; Pollack J.M.; Lewis C.,Grades and test scores: Accounting for observed differences,2002,39,"Why do grades and test scores often differ? A framework of possible differences is proposed in this article. An approximation of the framework was tested with data on 8,454 high school seniors from the National Education Longitudinal Study. Individual and group differences in grade versus test performance were substantially reduced by focusing the two measures on similar academic subjects, correcting for grading variations and unreliability, and adding teacher ratings and other information about students. Concurrent prediction of high school average was thus increased from 0.62 to 0.90; differential prediction in eight subgroups was reduced to 0.02 letter-grades. Grading variation was a major source of discrepancy between grades and test scores. Other major sources were teacher ratings and Scholastic Engagement, a promising organizing principle for understanding student achievement. Engagement was defined by three types of observable behavior: employing school skills, demonstrating initiative, and avoiding competing activities. While groups varied in average achievement, group performance was generally similar on grades and tests. Major factors in achievement were similarly constituted and similarly related from group to group. Differences between grades and tests give these measures complementary strengths in high-stakes assessment. If artifactual differences between the two measures are not corrected, common statistical estimates of validity and fairness are unduly conservative.","['grade', 'test', 'score', 'Accounting', 'observed', 'difference']","['grade', 'test', 'score', 'accounting', 'observed', 'difference']",grade test score accounting observed difference

Attali Y.; Bar-Hillel M.,Guess where: The position of correct answers in multiple-choice test items as a psychometric variable,2003,40,"In this article, the authors show that test makers and test takers have a strong and systematic tendency for hiding correct answers - or, respectively, for seeking them - in middle positions. In single, isolated questions, both prefer middle positions to extreme ones in a ratio of up to 3 or 4 to 1. Because test makers routinely, deliberately, and excessively balance the answer key of operational tests, middle bias almost, though not quite, disappears in those keys. Examinees taking real tests also produce answer sequences that are more balanced than their single question tendencies but less balanced than the correct key. In a typical four-choice test, about 55% of erroneous answers are in the two central positions. The authors show that this bias is large enough to have real psychometric consequences, as questions with middle correct answers are easier and less discriminating than questions with extreme correct answers, a fact of which some implications are explored.","['guess', 'position', 'correct', 'answer', 'multiplechoice', 'test', 'item', 'psychometric', 'variable']","['guess', 'position', 'correct', 'answer', 'multiplechoice', 'test', 'item', 'psychometric', 'variable']",guess position correct answer multiplechoice test item psychometric variable

The five methods were evaluated in terms of item-parameter recovery, using three different sample sizes (300, 1000 and 3000). The MEM method appeared to be the best choice among these, because it produced the smallest parameter-estimation errors for all sample size conditions. MEM and OEM are mathematically similar, although the OEM method produced larger errors. MEM also was preferable to OEM, unless the amount of time involved in iterative computation is a concern. Stocking's Method B also worked very well, but it required anchor items that either would increase test lengths or require larger sample sizes depending on test administration design. Until more appropriate ways of handling sparse data are devised, the BILOG/Prior method may not be a reasonable choice for small sample sizes. Stocking's Method A had the largest weighted total error, as well as a theoretical weakness (i.e., treating estimated ability as true ability); thus, there appeared to be little reason to use it.","['comparative', 'study', 'online', 'pret', 'itemcalibrationscaling', 'method', 'computerized', 'adaptive', 'testing']","['comparative', 'study', 'online', 'pret', 'itemcalibrationscaling', 'method', 'computerized', 'adaptive', 'testing']",comparative study online pret itemcalibrationscaling method computerized adaptive testing

Bolt D.M.,A SIBTEST approach to testing DIF hypotheses using experimentally designed test items,2000,37,"This paper considers a modification of the DIF procedure SIBTEST for investigating the causes of differential item functioning (DIF). One way in which factors believed to be responsible for DIF can be investigated is by systematically manipulating them across multiple versions of an item using a randomized DIF study (Schmitt, Holland, & Dorans, 1993). In this paper, it is shown that the additivity of the index used for testing DIF in SIBTEST motivates a new extension of the method for statistically testing the effects of DIF factors. Because an important consideration is whether or not a studied DIF factor is consistent in its effects across items, a methodology for testing item × factor interactions is also presented. Using data from the mathematical sections of the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT), the effects of two potential DIP factors - item formal (multiple-choice versus open-ended) and problem type (abstract versus concrete) - are investigated for gender. Results suggest a small but statistically significant and consistent effect of item format (favoring males for multiple-choice items) across items, and a larger but less consistent effect due to problem type.","['sibtest', 'approach', 'test', 'DIF', 'hypothesis', 'experimentally', 'design', 'test', 'item']","['sibtest', 'approach', 'test', 'dif', 'hypothesis', 'experimentally', 'design', 'test', 'item']",sibtest approach test dif hypothesis experimentally design test item

Rater severities in five successive periods were estimated using a modified linear logistic test model (LLTM, Fischer, 1973) approach. It was found that the raters did indeed drift towards the mean, but a planned comparision of the feedback with a control condition was not successful; it was believed that this was due to contamination at the table leader level. A series of models was also estimated designed to detect other types of rater effects beyond severity: a tendency to use extreme scores, and tendency to prefer certain categories. The models for these effects were found to be showing significant improvement in fit, implying that these effects were indeed present, although they were difficult to detect in relatively short time periods.","['Realtime', 'feedback', 'rater', 'drift', 'constructedresponse', 'item', 'example', 'golden', 'state', 'examination']","['realtime', 'feedback', 'rater', 'drift', 'constructedresponse', 'item', 'example', 'golden', 'state', 'examination']",realtime feedback rater drift constructedresponse item example golden state examination

Furthermore, it is shown that the two-level HGLM model can be extended to a three-level latent regression model that permits investigation of the variation of students' performance across groups, such as is found in classrooms and schools, and of the interactive effect of person-and group-characteristic variables.","['item', 'analysis', 'hierarchical', 'generalize', 'linear']","['item', 'analysis', 'hierarchical', 'generalize', 'linear']",item analysis hierarchical generalize linear
Yi Q.; Wang T.; Ban J.-C.,Effects of scale transformation and test-termination rule on the precision of ability estimation in computerized adaptive testing,2001,38,"Error indices (bias, standard error of estimation, and root mean squared error) obtained on different measurement scales under different test-termination rules in computerized adaptive testing (CAT) were examined. Four ability estimation methods (maximum likelihood estimation, weighted likelihood estimation, expected a posterior, and maximum a posterior), three measurement scales (θ, number-correct score, and ACT score), and three test-termination rules (fixed length, fixed standard error, and target information) were studied for a real and a generated item pool. The findings indicated that the amount and direction of bias, standard error of estimation, and root mean squared error obtained under different ability estimation methods were influenced both by scale transformations and by test-termination rules in a CAT environment.

Kane M.T.,Current concerns in validity theory,2001,38,"We are at the end of the first century of work on models of educational and psychological measurement and into a new millennium. This certainly seems like an appropriate time for looking backward and looking forward in assessment. Furthermore, a new edition of the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (AERA, APA, & NCME, 1999) has been published, and the previous editions of the Standards have served as benchmarks in the development of measurement theory. This backward glance will be just that, a glance. After a brief historical review focusing mainly on construct validity, the current state of validity theory will be summarized, with an emphasis on the role of arguments in validation. Then how an argument-based approach might be applied will be examined in regards to two issues in validity theory: the distinction between performance-based and theory-based interpretations, and the role of consequences in validation.","['current', 'concern', 'validity', 'theory']","['current', 'concern', 'validity', 'theory']",current concern validity theory
Pitkin A.K.; Vispoel W.P.,Differences between self-adapted and computerized adaptive tests: A meta-analysis,2001,38,"Self-adapted testing has been described as a variation of computerized adaptive testing that reduces test anxiety and thereby enhances test performance. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of these proposed effects of self-adapted tests (SATs); meta-analysis procedures were used to estimate differences between SATs and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) in proficiency estimates and post-test anxiety levels across studies in which these two types of tests have been compared. After controlling for measurement error, the results showed that SATs yielded proficiency estimates that were 0.12 standard deviation units higher and post-test anxiety levels that were 0.19 standard deviation units lower than those yielded by CATs. We speculate about possible reasons for these differences and discuss advantages and disadvantages of using SATs in operational settings.","['difference', 'selfadapted', 'computerized', 'adaptive', 'test', 'metaanalysis']","['difference', 'selfadapted', 'computerized', 'adaptive', 'test', 'metaanalysis']",difference selfadapted computerized adaptive test metaanalysis
Hau K.-T.; Chang H.-H.,Item selection in computerized adaptive testing: Should more discriminating be used first?,2001,38,"During computerized adaptive testing (CAT), items are selected continuously according to the test-taker's estimated ability. The traditional method of attaining the highest efficiency in ability estimation is to select items of maximum Fisher information at the currently estimated ability. Test security has become a problem because high-discrimination items are more likely to be selected and become overexposed. So, there seems to be a tradeoff between high efficiency in ability estimations and balanced usage of items. This series of four studies with simulated data addressed the dilemma by focusing on the notion of whether more or less discriminating items should be used first in CAT. The first study demonstrated that the common maximum information method with Sympson and Hetter (1985) control resulted in the use of more discriminating items first. The remaining studies showed that using items in the reverse order (i.e., less discriminating items first), as described in Chang and Ying's (1999) stratified method had potential advantages: (a) a more balanced item usage and (b) a relatively stable resultant item pool structure with easy and inexpensive management: This stratified method may have ability-estimation efficiency better than or close to that of other methods, particularly for operational item pools when retired items cannot be totally replenished with similar highly discriminating items. It is argued that the judicious selection of items, as in the stratified method, is a more active control of item exposure, which can successfully even out the usage of all items.","['item', 'selection', 'computerized', 'adaptive', 'testing', 'discriminating']","['item', 'selection', 'computerized', 'adaptive', 'testing', 'discriminating']",item selection computerized adaptive testing discriminating
Clauser B.E.; Swanson D.B.; Harik P.,Multivariate generalizability analysis of the impact of training and examinee performance information on judgments made in an Angoff-style standard-setting procedure,2002,39,"Cut scores, estimated using the Angoff procedure, are routinely used to make high-stakes classification decisions based on examinee scores. Precision is necessary in estimation of cut scores because of the importance of these decisions. Although much has been written about how these procedures should be implemented, there is relatively little literature providing empirical support for specific approaches to providing training and feedback to standard-setting judges. This article presents a multivariate generalizability analysis designed to examine the impact of training and feedback on various sources of error in estimation of cut scores for a standard-setting procedure in which multiple independent groups completed the judgments. The results indicate that after training, there was little improvement in the ability of judges to rank order items by difficulty but there was a substantial improvement in inter-judge consistency in centering ratings. The results also show a substantial group effect. Consistent with this result, the direction of change for the estimated cut score was shown to be group dependent.","['multivariate', 'generalizability', 'analysis', 'impact', 'training', 'examinee', 'performance', 'information', 'judgment', 'Angoffstyle', 'standardsetting', 'procedure']","['multivariate', 'generalizability', 'analysis', 'impact', 'training', 'examinee', 'performance', 'information', 'judgment', 'angoffstyle', 'standardsetting', 'procedure']",multivariate generalizability analysis impact training examinee performance information judgment angoffstyle standardsetting procedure
Gierl M.J.; Khaliq S.N.,Identifying sources of differential item and bundle functioning on translated achievement tests: A confirmatory analysis,2001,38,"Increasingly, tests are being translated and adapted into different languages. Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses are often used to identify non-equivalent items across language groups. However, few studies have focused on understanding why some translated items produce DIF. The purpose of the current study is to identify sources of differential item and bundle functioning on translated achievement tests using substantive and statistical analyses. A substantive analysis of existing DIF items was conducted by an 11-member committee of testing specialists. In their review, four sources of translation DIF were identified. Two certified translators used these four sources to categorize a new set of DIF items from Grade 6 and 9 Mathematics and Social Studies Achievement Tests. Each item was associated with a specific source of translation DIF and each item was anticipated to favor a specific group of examinees. Then, a statistical analysis was conducted on the items in each category using SIBTEST. The translators sorted the mathematics DIF items into three sources, and they correctly predicted the group that would he favored for seven of the eight items or bundles of items across two grade levels. The translators sorted the social studies DIF items into four sources, and they correctly predicted the group that would be favored for eight of the 13 items or bundles of items across two grade levels. The majority of items in mathematics and social studies were associated with differences in the words, expressions, or sentence structure of items that are not inherent to the language and/or culture. By combining substantive and statistical DIF analyses, researchers can study the sources of DIF and create a body of confirmed DIF hypotheses that may be used to develop guidelines and test construction principles for reducing DIF on translated tests.","['identify', 'source', 'differential', 'item', 'bundle', 'function', 'translate', 'achievement', 'test', 'confirmatory', 'analysis']","['identify', 'source', 'differential', 'item', 'bundle', 'function', 'translate', 'achievement', 'test', 'confirmatory', 'analysis']",identify source differential item bundle function translate achievement test confirmatory analysis

Our purpose in this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of CATs with such restricted review options in a live testing setting. Vocabulary CATs were compared under four conditions: (a) no item review allowed, (b) review allowed only within successive 5-item blocks, (c) review allowed only within successive 10-item blocks, and (d) review allowed only after answering all 40 items. Results revealed no trustworthy differences among conditions in vocabulary proficiency estimates, measurement error, or testing time. Within each review condition, ability estimates and number correct scores increased slightly after review, more answers were changed from wrong to right than from right to wrong, most examinees who changed answers improved proficiency estimates by doing so, and nearly all examinees indicated that they had an adequate opportunity to review their previous answers. These results suggest that restricting review opportunities on CATs may provide a viable way to satisfy examinee desires, maintain validity and measurement precision, and keep testing time at acceptable levels.","['limit', 'answer', 'review', 'change', 'computerized', 'adaptive', 'vocabulary', 'test', 'psychometric', 'attitudinal', 'result']","['limit', 'answer', 'review', 'change', 'computerized', 'adaptive', 'vocabulary', 'test', 'psychometric', 'attitudinal', 'result']",limit answer review change computerized adaptive vocabulary test psychometric attitudinal result
Caruso J.C.; Witkiewitz K.,Increasing the reliability of ability-achievement difference scores: An example using the Kaufman assessment battery for children,2002,39,"In this study, we focused on increasing the reliability of ability-achievement difference scores using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC) as an example. Ability-achievement difference scores are often used as indicators of learning disabilities, but when they are derived from traditional equally weighted ability and achievement scores, they have suboptimal psychometric properties because of the high correlations between the scores. As an alternative to equally weighted difference scores, we examined an orthogonal reliable component analysis (RCA) solution and an oblique principal component analysis (PCA) solution for the standardization sample of the KABC (among 5- to 12-year-olds). The components were easily identifiable as the simultaneous processing, sequential processing, and achievement constructs assessed by the KABC. As judged via the score intercorrelations, all three types of scores had adequate convergent validity, while the orthogonal RCA scores had superior discriminant validity, followed by the oblique PCA scores. Differences between the orthogonal RCA scores were more reliable than differences between the oblique PCA scores, which were in turn more reliable than differences between the traditional equally weighted scores. The increased reliability with which the KABC differences are assessed with the orthogonal RCA method has important practical implications, including narrower confidence intervals around difference scores used in individual administrations of the KABC.","['increase', 'reliability', 'abilityachievement', 'difference', 'score', 'example', 'Kaufman', 'assessment', 'battery', 'child']","['increase', 'reliability', 'abilityachievement', 'difference', 'score', 'example', 'kaufman', 'assessment', 'battery', 'child']",increase reliability abilityachievement difference score example kaufman assessment battery child
Clauser B.E.; Harik P.; Clyman S.G.,The generalizability of scores for a performance assessment scored with a computer-automated scoring system,2000,37,"When performance assessments are delivered and scored by computer, the costs of scoring may be substantially lower than those of scoring the same assessment based on expert review of the individual performances. Computerized scoring algorithms also ensure that the scoring rules are implemented precisely and uniformly. Such computerized algorithms represent an effort to encode the scoring policies of experts. This raises the question, would a different group of experts have produced a meaningfully different algorithm? The research reported in this paper uses generalizability theory to assess the impact of using independent, randomly equivalent groups of experts to develop the scoring algorithms for a set of computer-simulation tasks designed to measure physicians' patient management skills. The results suggest that the impact of this ""expert group"" effect may be significant but that it can be controlled with appropriate test development strategies.

Sykes R.C.; Yen W.M.,The scaling of mixed-item-format tests with the one-parameter and two-parameter partial credit models,2000,37,"Item response theory scalings were conducted for six tests with mixed item formats. These tests differed in their proportions of constructed response (c.r.) and multiple choice (m.c.) items and in overall difficulty. The scalings included those based on scores for the c.r. items that had maintained the number of levels as the item rubrics, either produced from single ratings or multiple ratings that were averaged and rounded to the nearest integer, as well as scalings for a single form of c.r. items obtained by summing multiple ratings. A one-parameter (1PPC) or two-parameter (2PPC) partial credit model was used for the c.r. items and the one-parameter logistic (1PL) or three-parameter logistic (3PL) model for the m.c. items. Item fit was substantially worse with the combination 1PL/1PPC model than the 3PL/2PPC model due to the former's restrictive assumptions that there would be no guessing on the m.c. items and equal item discrimination across items and item types. The presence of varying item discriminations resulted in the 1PL/1PPC model producing estimates of item information that could be spuriously inflated for c.r. items that had three or more score levels. Information for some items with summed ratings were usually overestimated by 300% or more for the 1PL/1PPC model. These inflated information values resulted in under-estimated standard errors of ability estimates. The constraints posed by the restricted model suggests limitations on the testing contexts in which the 1PL/1PPC model can be accurately applied.","['scaling', 'mixeditemformat', 'test', 'oneparameter', 'twoparameter', 'partial', 'credit']","['scaling', 'mixeditemformat', 'test', 'oneparameter', 'twoparameter', 'partial', 'credit']",scaling mixeditemformat test oneparameter twoparameter partial credit

Wainer H.; Sheehan K.M.; Wang X.,Some paths toward making praxis scores more useful,2000,37,"In this study we describe an analytic method for aiding in the generation of subscales that characterize the deep structure of tests. In addition we also derive a procedure for estimating scores for these scales that are much more statistically stable than subscores computed solely from the items that are contained on that scale. These scores achieve their stability through augmentation with information from other related information on the test. These methods were used to complement each other on a data set obtained from a Praxis administration. We found that the deep structure of the test yielded ten subscales and that, because the test was essentially unidimensional, ten subscores could be computed, all with very high reliability. This result was contrasted with the calculation of six traditional subscales based on surface features of the items. These subscales also yielded augmented subscores of high reliability.","['path', 'praxis', 'score', 'useful']","['path', 'praxis', 'score', 'useful']",path praxis score useful
Dorans N.J.; Holland P.W.,Population invariance and the equatability of tests: Basic theory and the linear case,2000,37,"How does the fact that two tests should not be equated manifest itself? This paper addresses this question through the study of the degree to which equating functions fail to exhibit population invariance across subpopulations. Equating functions are supposed to be population invariant by definition. But, when two tests are not equatable, it is possible that the linking functions, used to connect the scores of one to the scores of the other, are not invariant across different populations of examinees. While no acceptable equating function is ever completely population invariant, in the situations where equating is usually performed we believe that the dependence of the equating function on the population used to compute it is usually small enough to be ignored. We introduce two root-mean-square difference measures of the degree to which the functions used to link two tests computed on different subpopulations differ from the linking function computed for the whole population. We also introduce the system of ""parallel-linear"" linking functions for multiple subpopulations and show that, for this system, our measure of population invariance can be computed easily from the standardized mean differences between the scores of the subpopulations on the two tests. For the parallel-linear case, we develop a correlation-based upper bound on our measure that holds for all systems of subpopulations. We illustrate these ideas using data from the SAT I and from a concordance study of several combinations of ACT and SAT I scores. In the appendices, we give some theoretical results bearing on the other equating ""requirements"" of ""same construct,"" ""same reliability"" and one aspect of Lord's concept of equity.","['population', 'invariance', 'equatability', 'test', 'basic', 'theory', 'linear', 'case']","['population', 'invariance', 'equatability', 'test', 'basic', 'theory', 'linear', 'case']",population invariance equatability test basic theory linear case

Sotaridona L.S.; Meijer R.R.,Two new statistics to detect answer copying,2003,40,"Two new indices to detect answer copying on a multiple-choice test - S1 and S2 - were proposed. The S1 index is similar to the K index (Holland, 1996) and the K̄2 index (Sotaridona & Meijer, 2002) but the distribution of the number of matching incorrect answers of the source and the copier is modeled by the Poisson distribution instead of the binomial distribution to improve the detection rate of K and K̄2. The S2 index was proposed to overcome a limitation of the K and K̄2 index, namely, their insensitiveness to correct answers copying. The S2 index incorporates the matching correct answers in addition to the matching incorrect answers. A simulation study was conducted to investigate the usefulness of S1 and S2 for 40- and 80-item tests, 100 and 500 sample sizes, and 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% answer copying. The Type I errors and detection rates of S1 and S2 were compared with those of the K̄2 and the ω copying index (Wollack, 1997). Results showed that all four indices were able to maintain their Type I errors, with S1 and K̄2 being slightly conservative compared to S2 and ω. Furthermore, S1 had higher detection rates than K̄2.

A spatial ability test that consists of an object assembly task highlights how cognitive design principles can lead to item generation.","['improve', 'construct', 'validity', 'cognitive', 'psychology', 'principle']","['improve', 'construct', 'validity', 'cognitive', 'psychology', 'principle']",improve construct validity cognitive psychology principle
Dorans N.J.,Recentering and realigning the SAT score distributions: How and why,2002,39,"The process employed to produce the conversions that take scores from the original SAT scales to recentered scales, in which reference group scores are centered near the midpoint of the score-reporting range, is laid out. For the purposes of this article, SAT Verbal and SAT Mathematical scores were placed on recentered scales, which have reporting ranges of 920 to 980, means of 950, and standard deviations of 11. (The 920-to-980 scale is used in this article to highlight the distinction between it and the old 200-to-800 scale. In actuality, recentered scores were reported on a 200-to-800 scale.) Recentering was accomplished via a linear transformation of normally distributed scores that were obtained from a continuized, smoothed frequency distribution of original SAT scores that were originally on augmented two-digit scales (i.e., discrete scores rounded to either 0 or 5 in the third decimal place). These discrete scores were obtained for all students in the 1990 Reference Group using 35 different editions of the SAT spanning October 1988 to June 1990. The performance of this 1990 Reference Group on the original and recentered scales is described. The effects of recentering on scores of individuals and the 1990 Reference Group are also examined. Finally, recentering did not occur solely on the basis of its technical merit. Issues associated with converting recentering from a possibility into a reality are discussed.","['recentere', 'realign', 'SAT', 'score', 'distribution']","['recentere', 'realign', 'sat', 'score', 'distribution']",recentere realign sat score distribution
Wainer H.; Wang X.,Using a new statistical model for testlets to score TOEFL,2000,37,"Standard item response theory (IRT) models fit to examination responses ignore the fact that sets of items (testlets) often are matched with a single common stimulus (e.g., a reading comprehension passage). In this setting, all items given to an examinee are unlikely to be conditionally independent (given examinee proficiency). Models that assume conditional independence will overestimate the precision with which examinee proficiency is measured. Overstatement of precision may lead to inaccurate inferences as well as prematurely ended examinations in which the stopping rule is based on the estimated standard error of examinee proficiency (e.g., an adaptive test). The standard three parameter IRT model was modified to include an additional random effect for items nested within the same testlet (Wainer, Bradlow, & Du, 2000). This parameter, γ, characterizes the amount of local dependence in a testlet. We fit 86 TOEFL testlets (50 reading comprehension and 36 listening comprehension) with the new model, and obtained a value for the variance of γ for each testlet. We compared the standard parameters (discrimination (a), difficulty (b) and guessing (c)) with what is obtained through traditional modeling. We found that difficulties were well estimated either way, but estimates of both a and c were biased if conditional independence is incorrectly assumed. Of greater import, we found that test information was substantially over-estimated when conditional independence was incorrectly assumed.","['new', 'statistical', 'testlet', 'score', 'toefl']","['new', 'statistical', 'testlet', 'score', 'toefl']",new statistical testlet score toefl
Scrams D.J.; McLeod L.D.,An expected response function approach to graphical differential item functioning,2000,37,"In this paper a new approach to graphical differential item functioning (DIF) is offered. The methodology is based on a sampling-theory approach to expected response functions (Lewis, 1985; Mislevy, Wingersky, & Sheehan, 1994). Essentially, error in item calibrations is modeled explicitly, and repeated samples are taken from the posterior distributions of the item parameters. Sampled parameter values are used to estimate the posterior distribution of the difference in item characteristic curves (ICCs) for two groups. A point-wise expectation is taken as an estimate of the true difference between the ICCs, and the sampled-difference functions indicate uncertainty in the estimate. The approach is applied to a set of pretest items, and the results are compared to traditional Mantel-Haenszel DIF statistics. The expected-response-function approach is contrasted with Pashley's (1992) graphical DIF approach.","['expected', 'response', 'function', 'approach', 'graphical', 'differential', 'item', 'function']","['expected', 'response', 'function', 'approach', 'graphical', 'differential', 'item', 'function']",expected response function approach graphical differential item function
Bassiri D.; Schulz E.M.,Constructing a universal scale of high school course difficulty,2003,40,"This study examined the usefulness of applying the Rasch rating scale model (Andrich, 1978) to high school grade data. ACT Assessment test scores (English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science Reasoning) were used as ""common items"" to adjust for different grading standards in individual high school courses both within and across schools. This scaling approach yielded an ACT Assessment-adjusted high school grade point average (AA-HSGPA) on a common scale across high schools and cohorts within a large public university. AA-HSGPA was a better predictor of first-year college grade point average (CGPA) than the regular high school grade point average. The best model for predicting CGPA included both the ACT composite score and AA-HSGPA.","['construct', 'universal', 'scale', 'high', 'school', 'course', 'difficulty']","['construct', 'universal', 'scale', 'high', 'school', 'course', 'difficulty']",construct universal scale high school course difficulty
Penfield R.D.; Algina J.,Applying the Liu-Agresti Estimator of the Cumulative Common Odds Ratio to DIF Detection in Polytomous Items,2003,40,"Liu and Agresti (1996) proposed a Mantel and Haenszel-type (1959) estimator of a common odds ratio for several 2 × J tables, where the J columns are ordinal levels of a response variable. This article applies the Liu-Agresti estimator to the case of assessing differential item functioning (DIF) in items having an ordinal response variable. A simulation study was conducted to investigate the accuracy of the Liu-Agresti estimator in relation to other statistical DIF detection procedures. The results of the simulation study indicate that the Liu-Agresti estimator is a viable alternative to other DIF detection statistics.","['apply', 'LiuAgresti', 'Estimator', 'Cumulative', 'Common', 'Odds', 'ratio', 'DIF', 'Detection', 'Polytomous', 'Items']","['apply', 'liuagresti', 'estimator', 'cumulative', 'common', 'odds', 'ratio', 'dif', 'detection', 'polytomous', 'items']",apply liuagresti estimator cumulative common odds ratio dif detection polytomous items
Cole N.S.; Zieky M.J.,The new faces of fairness,2001,38,"For most of the 20th century, measurement professionals paid little interest to item and test fairness. A confluence of events in the late 1960s and early 1970s led to an intense interest in fairness issues among measurement professionals. In spite of more than 30 years of effort, there is still no generally accepted definition of fairness with respect to testing and no measure that can prove or disprove the fairness of a test. To advance the fairness of tests, measurement professionals must pay more attention to reducing group differences at the design stage of test development, to providing all examinees an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and skills, to deterring test misuse, and to accommodating differences among individuals.","['new', 'face', 'fairness']","['new', 'face', 'fairness']",new face fairness
Stone C.A.,Monte Carlo based null distribution for an alternative goodness-of-fit test statistic in IRT models,2000,37,"Assessing the correspondence between model predictions and observed data is a recommended procedure for justifying the application of an IRT model. However, with shorter tests, current goodness-of-fit procedures that assume precise point estimates of ability, are inappropriate. The present paper describes a goodness-of-fit statistic that considers the imprecision with which ability is estimated and involves constructing item fit tables based on each examinee's posterior distribution of ability, given the likelihood of their response pattern and an assumed marginal ability distribution. However, the posterior expectations that are computed are dependent and the distribution of the goodness-of-fit statistic is unknown. The present paper also describes a Monte Carlo resampling procedure that can be used to assess the significance of the fit statistic and compares this method with a previously used method. The results indicate that the method described herein is an effective and reasonably simple procedure for assessing the validity of applying IRT models when ability estimates are imprecise.","['Monte', 'Carlo', 'base', 'null', 'distribution', 'alternative', 'goodnessoffit', 'test', 'statistic', 'IRT']","['monte', 'carlo', 'base', 'null', 'distribution', 'alternative', 'goodnessoffit', 'test', 'statistic', 'irt']",monte carlo base null distribution alternative goodnessoffit test statistic irt
